Bridgy Fed status update

Hi all! I finally got another big bit of [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) interop working earlier today: bridging Bluesky replies, likes, and reposts into the fediverse. (Only the Bluesky [federation sandbox](https://atproto.com/blog/federation-developer-sandbox), not real users, since federation is still months away.)

Here are example screenshots:

<a href="/backfed-notifs-in-fediverse.png">

Lots more bug fixes, cleanup, and testing to do, but it's nice to get this far.

Beyond development I'm now also starting to ramp up a bit of outreach. The IndieWeb and Bluesky communities are supportive, and the fediverse admins and community representatives I've approached so far have been generally positive, but I need to talk to more people there. Now is the right time, when I still have months to hear and incorporate feedback before Bluesky federates and I'm able to ship Bridgy Fed's Bluesky support.

Until next time!
