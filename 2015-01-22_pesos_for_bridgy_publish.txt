*[POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE)ing silo interactions is
[getting harder by the day](https://kylewm.com/2015/01/the-facebook-api-v2-0-is-hobbled-to-prevent-spammy),
and [Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish) is suffering as a
result. We could fix this by adding an
[OwnYourGram](http://ownyourgram.com/)-style
[PESOS](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS) option. Should we?*

If you're going to [own your posts](https://indiewebcamp.com/ownyourdata) on social
networks, [indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com/) people
[prefer to POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE#Advantages): post on your own
site, syndicate elsewhere. [Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish)
follows this philosophy and provides POSSE as a service.

POSSE has its disadvantages though. The Twitter app, for example, lets you
favorite a tweet with a single tap and ~100ms latency. Best of breed mobile
indieweb approaches can't touch that right now. Mine, for example, take
[many more taps](/easy-indieweb-interactions-on-android)
[and 10-20s](/indie-checkin-flow). Browser-based implementations and
[webactions](https://indiewebcamp.com/webactions) are a bit better, but not
much.

The [silos](https://indiewebcamp.com/silo) don't even allow POSSEing
[interactions](https://indiewebcamp.com/interactions) consistently, if at all.
Facebook's 2.0 API often
[prevents commenting](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/350),
[liking](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/user/likes#publish),
[and resharing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.2/object/sharedposts#publish).
Instagram's API
[supports liking but not commenting](https://indiewebcamp.com/Instagram#API).
Google+'s API [is read only](https://indiewebcamp.com/Google%2B#POSSE), full
stop. Twitter has a fairly complete write API, but must be taken with a
[grain of salt](https://indiewebcamp.com/Twitter#Developer_Relations).

Proposal: what if we added a Bridgy Publish PESOS option alongside the current
POSSE model?

The arguments [for POSSE](https://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE#Advantages) and
[against PESOS](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS#Disadvantages) are well founded.
They're also aimed primarily at posts, not interactions. For interactions with
single silo posts, especially likes and reposts - which rarely include additional
content - PESOS ain't so bad, and it comes with two big benefits:

* Full support for all interactions in all silos.
* Use the silos' native UXes (often single-tap and low latency), databases
(venues, contacts, etc.), and other features (e.g. character counting) for free.
No need to reimplement them or bolt them onto your own site.

Some of the [PESOS drawbacks](https://indiewebcamp.com/PESOS#Disadvantages)
still apply. It enables silo-first authoring and presentation and may discourage
indie and cross-silo interactions. Those would be just as doable, though, since
we'd keep the current POSSE functionality.

This would be a big project, but it's doable. Bridgy would watch your silo
account for replies, likes, and reshares that it didn't create. When it sees
one, it creates a matching original post on your site, via
[micropub](http://micropub.net/) or whatever. (I despair at implementing even
just the [token management](https://indiewebcamp.com/micropub#Authentication),
much less a full micropub client, but those are literally implementation
details.)

Thoughts?

_Update:_ To flesh this out a bit, here's what I could and couldn't do with each
of the four main silos.

**Twitter** has a [streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis)
that sends events for new favorites and tweets (including @-replies and
retweets). Bridgy
[has used it before](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/blob/master/twitter_streaming.py).
[It broke when Bridgy went over 100ish Twitter users](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/57),
but it would work for just one user. Even so,
[it's a bit expensive on App Engine](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/8),
so I'd probably just poll
[`/statuses/user_timeline`](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline) and
[`/favorites/list`](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/favorites/list).

**Facebook**'s
[Real Time Updates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/real-time-updates/)
should work. I've already used it in
[ownyourcheckin](https://github.com/snarfed/ownyourcheckin). I'd subscribe to
`/user/likes` and `/user/feed`, which I _think_ should include comments.
I could also poll those endpoints.

**Google+** has no way to get comments *or* +1s by user, only by post.

**Instagram** can get
[likes by user](http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/users/#get_users_feed_liked),
but [not comments](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22002350/186123).
