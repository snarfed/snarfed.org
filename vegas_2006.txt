Vegas 2006

Pictures from our Vegas trip in August 2006. We had a
big group, over 20 people, and we graced
[Sushi Roku](http://www.sushiroku.com/sushiroku/),
[Tao](http://www.venetian.com/attractions/tao.cfm),
[Taqueria Ca√±onita](http://www.venetian.com/dining/canonita.cfm),
[Tryst](http://www.trystlasvegas.com/)
([more](http://cityguide.aol.com/lasvegas/bars/tryst/v-119968467)),
and

with our presence. Everyone had a blast. It was, for lack of a better word,
epic.

I blatantly stole the pictures from
[Dan's](http://picasaweb.google.com/dlpeters/VegasFun2006),
[Ken's](http://picasaweb.google.com/kashcraft/LasVegas),
[Maulik's](http://picasaweb.google.com/maulik/Vegas2006),
and
[Tiaunia's](http://www.kodakgallery.com/ShareLandingReg.jsp?Uc=gtf8zws.91u6wrqc&Uy=-3o8bny&Upost_signin=Slideshow.jsp%3Fmode%3Dfromshare&Ux=0&UV=620140660685_387163161108)
albums. Thanks for the pictures, guys, and thanks to MJ for hosting and
Tina for helping plan the trip!
