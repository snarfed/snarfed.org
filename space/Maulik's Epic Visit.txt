Maulik's Epic Visit
OK, I know it's Friday - well, technically Saturday - , and I'm just now getting
around to posting about what I did _last_ weekend. It was an epic weekend. Don't
worry, though, I didn't write an epic poem about it...just a rather long post.

  * **Friday**

Since the beginning of last year, [Ken](/space/kash) and
[Nick](http://www.stanford.edu/~koshnick/) have throw a dance party every
quarter, often with "supervision" from
[Peter](http://www.orkut.com/Profile.aspx?uid=7749662450751490942),
[Isaac](http://klamath.stanford.edu/~keslassy/),
[Bill](http://www.stanford.edu/~wmagrath/), and [me](/space/ryan)). The parties
were very successful and grew to be quite big, quite fast, due in no small part
to their infamous [video
invitations](http://keeda.stanford.edu/~kash/kashnick/), There are a few
pictures from past parties posted. (Ooh...palliteration!)

Unfortunately, life came down hard on the residents of 303 College Ave. this
quarter, and free time was hard to come by. So, in lieu of a full-fledged dance
party, Ken, Nick, and Peter hosted a barbeque. The same crowd came, but instead
of bumping and grinding with the lights turned off, we actually spent the whole
time socializing. It was a radical idea, and they knew it was risky, but it
turned out to be lots of fun for everyone involved. Moreover, a special
celebrity guest - [Maulik](/space/Maulik) - flew in just for this event! Lucky
for us, he had so much fun that he decided to stay for the
weekend.![/space/hydrate_small.jpg](/space/hydrate_small.jpg)

After the barbeque, [Nathan](http://xenon.stanford.edu/~nstoll) and I caravanned
up to the city. We headed straight for [Cloud
9](http://www.maximumproductions.com/cloud9.htm), where fellow Googlers [Josh
McFarland](http://mytwofrontteeth.org/management.html) and [Mike
Stoppelman](http://www.mike.stoppelman.com/) were the promoters for a party
called [Hydrate](http://jdmc.smugmug.com/gallery/112307/1/4020938/Large). It was
a blast. It was saturated with Stanford and Google people, so we couldn't take
more than a few steps without bumping into people we knew, but hadn't seen for a
while. It was almost reminiscent of a frat party, but in a nice venue, with good
music, good drinks, and a fun crowd. (OK, so maybe it wasn't reminiscent of a
frat party after all.)

  * **Saturday**

The next morning, I woke up, went to the gym, and did absolutely nothing
noteworthy. Luckily, Maulik and Ken showed up around 6pm and dragged me out of
the apartment. We picked up Nathan and headed straight for Berkeley's famous
sari district, where Maulik went shopping. After picking out a few saris, he
haggled one seller's price from $300 down to $26.10, a Bart ticket, and a
invitation to Gmail. We were impressed, but Maulik wasn't. In India, he said, he
could have bought them for a few rupees and a stick of
gum.![/space/zacharys_small.jpg](/space/zacharys_small.jpg)

By this time, we were starving. We picked up **John** and headed straight for
[Zachary's Pizza](http://zacharys.com/), a Berkeley tradition. If you've never
had Zachary's, it's best described as lasagna with pizza dough instead of pasta.
It's, for lack of a better word, _substantial_. Of course, we figured even
Zachary's wasn't enough for six hungry guys, so we stopped by Safeway on the way
back to John's house. **Walter** met us there, and we all got down to the
serious business of eating pizza and watching basketball.

_Contented silence._

Ok. Satiated, we started planning our next move. We discussed our options, and
decided our best bet was to get up off the couch.

Fifteen minutes later, we got up off the couch. We connected with **Kieran**,
\_\_Denise\_\_, and a group of John's friends, and we all headed out to
[Belladonna](http://belladonna.ws), Berkeley's premiere women's spiritual
healing, divination, exorcism, and day spa center. Oh, and cafe. (It had space
for 50 people. Maybe. Assuming they're all
midgets.)![/space/frontalot_small.jpg](/space/frontalot_small.jpg)

Unlikely, yes, but Belladonna was the venue for a
[Songfight](http://songfight.com/) concert featuring the one, the only, the
incomparable [MC Frontalot](http://frontalot.com/). Frontalot is a practitioner
of [nerdcore
hiphop](http://frontalot.songhole.org/mc_frontalot_-_nerdcore_hiphop.mp3), and
he's damn good at what he does. Front rocked the house. Maulik and I have been
listening to him for years, so we loved every minute of it. But more
importantly, most of the people in our group had never heard him before, and
even so, they had a blast. Maulik and I bought t-shirts and CDs, and, get this,
Maulik forgot to haggle. It was that good.

After the concert, smiling and rubbing our ears, we headed back to the city and
made a beeline straight for [Ruby Skye](http://www.rubyskye.com/), where
**Lissandra** and a few friends held their birthday party. There, I patronized
an [oxygen bar](http://www.wordspy.com/words/oxygenbar.asp) for the first time,
which was a cute gimmick, if harmless. Apart from that, and some illicit
gambling on the night's activities, we all partied like rock stars until they
kicked us out. Well, most of us did...some people left early because they had to
get up early for some running thing. [Bet you're
Bonkers](http://baytobreakers.com/), I think it was called.

  * **Sunday**

Ken and Maulik crashed at my place on Saturday night. Sunday morning, I woke up
hungry, and went out to grab them and head for the cafeteria. Then I realized
that, even if they were sleeping in the next room, we weren't in college any
more. So, we headed to Delancey Street Restaurant for breakfast. I have a Sunday
morning tradition there - I order a pumpkin waffle, the waiter smiles, and ten
minutes later I get an omelette. Or pancakes. Or pretty much anything _except_ a
pumpkin waffle. The guys at Penny Arcade had a [similar
experience](http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=2001-03-31&res=l) with
Amazon, and they weren't amused either.

After breakfast, we realized that we'd spent almost an entire weekend away from
computers. We were beginning to see withdrawal symptoms, so we figured the best
cure would be a good hit of unadulterated tech geekiness. [Wired's
Nextfest](http://nextfest.net/) at Fort Mason was just the
ticket.![/space/coat_small.jpg](/space/coat_small.jpg)

We spent a couple hours driving, parking, standing in line, walking, and
standing in line some more. We were doing a convincing impression of cattle when
we finally made it into the building. The show included an odd amalgam of
corporate R&D, tech marketing razzle-dazzle, and actual substantive research
project from [DARPA](http://www.darpa.mil/), [NSF](http://nsf.gov/), and the
[MIT Media Lab](http://www.media.mit.edu/). The standouts included flying cars,
a coat that turns you transparent, and videogames you control with your mind.
(No, I'm not kidding.) Guest speakers included John Carmack of [id
Software](http://idsoftware.com/) and [Armadillo
Aerospace](http://armadilloaerospace.com/)
fame.![/space/skycar_small.jpg](/space/skycar_small.jpg)

Whew! Writing all of that down wasn't quite as tiring as actually doing it...but
still, I'm out of jokes. Take pity on me, and imagine a funny closing punchline.
Or, even better, start looking forward to Ken/Nick/Peter's next party! Light-up
dance floor, anyone?
