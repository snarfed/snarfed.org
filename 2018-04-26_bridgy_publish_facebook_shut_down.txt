[Bridgy Publish](https://brid.gy/about#publishing) [launched four years ago](https://snarfed.org/2014-03-25_bridgy-publish) with the ability to create posts, RSVPs, comments, and likes on Facebook and other silos. It's created [over 30k silo posts since then](https://brid.gy/#stats) ([details](https://snarfed.org/2018-01-02_bridgy-stats-update-3)), [7k on Facebook specifically](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/savedquery/586366768654:491a0ec89c3f43acb62acce67062004f).

After the [Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal) broke, Facebook started limiting its API in a number of ways. Notably, [it disabled RSVPing yesterday, and will disable posting on August 1,](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/) which will effectively kill Bridgy Publish.

I'll send Facebook notifications to warn users that they only have a few months left. RIP Bridgy Publish for Facebook, we'll miss you. So long, and thanks for all the fish!
