## rel-me links

The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/rel-me) is a community that uses personal web sites to interact with each other, both directly and indirectly via other linked online accounts and tools.

An IndieWeb community member's primary online identity is their web site, specifically their domain. Ownership of the domain, and serving HTTP on it over TLS with a valid certificate, is considered proof that any content or assertions published on the site comes from that person.

An IndieWeb community member connects their web site to their other online accounts with [`rel-me` HTML links](https://indieweb.org/rel-me) that point to them in various ways. For example, my home page [snarfed.org](https://snarfed.org/) has `rel-me` links like these (some real, some examples) to other accounts of mine:

```html
<a rel="me" href="https://twitter.com/schnarfed">Twitter</a>
<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.technology/@snarfed">Mastodon</a>
<a rel="me" href="mailto:bluesky@ryanb.org">Email</a>
<a rel="me pgpkey" href="/pubkey.txt">PGP public key</a>
<a rel="me payment" href="bitcoin:1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx">Bitcoin</a>
```

A `rel-me` link asserts that the target address identifies another identity or account owned by this person. Some of these other accounts, eg Mastodon, may include `rel-me` links that point back to the original web site, but that's not required to assert identity.

## Authentication

`rel-me` links allow a form of distributed authentication. When we fetch someone's home page and read their `rel-me` links, we get a set of accounts that the site's owner asserts that they own. So, if someone authenticates with one of those linked accounts via OAuth, or provides a signature that matches a linked public key, or provides a confirmation code sent to a linked email address, they've authenticated as the site's owner.

[IndieAuth](https://indieauth.net/) is one widely used authentication scheme that works this way, along with its predecessor [RelMeAuth](https://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth).

## Interactions

The IndieWeb community has gone far beyond `rel-me` links to implement a wide variety of social networking features between decentralized, independent personal web sites, including [replies](https://indieweb.org/reply), [reposts](https://indieweb.org/repost), [likes](https://indieweb.org/like), [emoji reactions](https://indieweb.org/reactions), [events](https://indieweb.org/event), [RSVPs](https://indieweb.org/rsvp), and more. These are based on simple, proven building blocks like DNS domains, HTTP and TLS, HTML with [microformats 2](https://microformats.org/), and the [Webmention](https://webmention.net/) W3C standard protocol. The community has also built [bridges](https://brid.gy/) that translate these rich interactions to and from proprietary silos like Twitter.

[There are tens of thousands of IndieWeb community participants](https://indiemap.org/) using these techniques. There are also hundreds of [independent, interoperating implementations](https://indieweb.org/projects) of these core standards and protocols, and [dozens of tools and services](https://indieweb.org/tools) that add features and make it easy for new people to join.
