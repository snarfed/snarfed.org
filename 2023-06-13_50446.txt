<p>Icky horrible thought of the day: what do we think about AI-generated child porn/CSAM?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On one hand, it's horrible, and icky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other hand, as an alternative to actual real CSAM, the harm reduction seems huge.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the other other hand, are there other dangers to allowing this kind of material to proliferate more widely? Eg for people who want it, does easier access sate them? Or fuel their urge for more? Does it make them less likely to go do something bad in real life? Or more?</p>
