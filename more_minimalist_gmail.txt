[more_minimalist_gmail.css](https://raw.github.com/snarfed/misc/master/userscripts/more_minimalist_gmail.css)
is a [userstyle](http://userstyles.org/help/userstyles) that hides most of
Google Gmail's UI, leaving simplified view of your email, labels, and search
box. It's intended for people who primarily use Gmail via the keyboard.

It was inspired by [Matt Constantine](http://mattconstantine.com/)'s
[Minimalist Gmail](http://mattconstantine.com/mg) browser extension, which I
used for a while and liked. It's out of date, though, and the userstyle goes
further, hides more, and since it's a userstyle, is much simpler.

More Minimalist Gmail also has
[its own page](http://userstyles.org/styles/35678) on
[userstyles.org](http://userstyles.org/).

Tips:

  * Use keyboard shortcuts! This userstyle expects that you do; it's pretty
  much unusable otherwise.
  [Details here.](http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=6594)
  (There are a few undocumented ones too, including - in the new UI -
  Ctrl-Shift-T/C/B to jump to the To, CC, ex BCC boxes.)
  * If you're using [Stylish](http://userstyles.org/help/stylish), you can
    temporarily show the hidden features by turning off Stylish. Click the
    Stylish icon and select _Turn all styles off_. When you're done, select
    _Turn all styles on_. Bonus tip: if you do this often,
    [add a keyboard shortcut with keyconfig](/firefox_keyconfig_extension).
  * You can hide individual labels in the
  [GMail settings Labels tab](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/labels).
  This includes built in labels like Starred, Important, Chats, Circles, etc.
