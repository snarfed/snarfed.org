I use a [homegrown shell script](/blogpost) to publish my posts on this site. When I [migrated to WordPress](/2010-08-08_migrated_to_wordpress), I imported lots of existing posts and pages that I also wanted to be able to update with blogpost.py. So, I wrote a script to generate the `.blogpost` files for those posts and pages: [generate_blogpost.sh](https://github.com/snarfed/wordpress/blob/main/generate_blogpost.sh).

The script isn't too complicated. It just fetches all existing pages and posts from MySQL, finds the corresponding `.txt` files in the working directory, and generates corresponding `.blogpost` files using the post ids, types, titles, and permalinks stored in the database.

To run it, simply pass the same parameters you'd pass to `mysql`, e.g.

    $ ./generate_blogpost.sh -h [HOST] -u [USER] [DATABASE]
