Goodbye Facebook, Goodbye Google+

I deleted [all of my Facebook posts](https://www.facebook.com/snarfed.org) last week. I deleted [all of my Google+ posts](https://plus.google.com/+RyanBarrett) too. They were pretty much all already here on my web site too, so nothing is truly lost, but I still feel a bit lighter, somehow.

Plenty of ink has been spilled on the problems with big social media and the companies behind it. There's [an entire movement of people leaving social networks](https://indieweb.org/silo-quits), either some or all of them, for various reasons. Many of them have expressed their concerns, often quite loudly and eloquently, so I don't really need to repeat them here. Consider yourselves lucky.

Google+ was the easy one. It never really took off. [Google plans to shut it down entirely in a couple months](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/). I occasionally had good conversations with old Google coworkers there, but even those slowly evaporated over time. So long, and thanks for all the fish.

Facebook, surprisingly, wasn't much harder. I'd gradually become dissatisfied with the company over time, so I was already using the product less and less. I only posted six times in 2018. Regardless, it's still the one social network that has all the people I care about in real life. I'll miss posting [pictures of my daughter](/2018-12-05_30775) - even if they're just [links to the actual photos here](/pictures) - and knowing my extended family, high school friends, and other parents at school will all see them.

I haven't deleted my account. Facebook is still basically a public utility. It's the modern white pages. It's where I look up old colleagues and pitch them to [join Color](https://www.color.com/careers). It's where I hear a long lost friend got married, or had a baby. It's the app I use in a Lyft on the way to a party, where I know I'll see acquaintances I haven't seen in a long time, and I want to catch up on who they are, or what they've been up to, or embarrassingly but most important, remind myself of their names.

Also, I'm totally inconsistent about this whole "I don't like the company, so I'll stop contributing to their product" thing. I [still post on Instagram occasionally](https://www.instagram.com/snarfed/). I still use WhatsApp. I may leave those too, eventually, but not just yet.

But I don't plan to _post_ on Facebook, or Google+, any more. Two more steps toward consolidating my online presence [here, on my own web site](https://indieweb.org/). Like God intended.
