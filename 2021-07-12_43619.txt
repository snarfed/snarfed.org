<p>How do we manage our family finances? Let me tell you a story.</p>

<ol><li>Purchase TurboTax.</li><li>Close my eyes.</li><li>Click the <em>Next</em> button 50 times in a row.</li><li>Enter my bank account details and let the IRS take their money. I rarely noticed how much it was.</li></ol>

<p>Gina was horrified, and I was never allowed near our finances again. That arrangement has worked out well for everyone involved, including our portfolio.</p>



<p>(The flipside of this is, I approached investing the same way. My strategy over the past 20+ years has been to buy Vanguard funds and then forget about them. All things considered, that's done pretty damn well.)</p>
