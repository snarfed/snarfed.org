Windsurfing at Shoreline

I've been going windsurfing at [Shoreline Lake](http://shorelinelake.com/)
a fair amount recently. I'm definitely still a beginner, but I'm having a lot
of fun at it.

[Dan](http://kodiak.brainymonkey.com/) and Jane came out to watch us and take
pictures recently. More on his
[blog post](http://kodiak.brainymonkey.com/index.php/2007/07/02/windsurfing-at-shoreline/)
and

Thanks, Dan!
