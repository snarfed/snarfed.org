Came across this gem while re-listening to [The Blueprint 3](http://genius.com/albums/Jay-z/The-blueprint-3):



> [On another level, on another plane already  

> H-O-V, I got my own lane already](http://rap.genius.com/2577)



And then this one from [Watch the Throne](http://genius.com/albums/Kanye-west/Watch-the-throne):



> [I feel the pain in my city wherever I go  

> 314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago](http://rap.genius.com/312732)



Say what you will about Jay-Z's and Kanye's personal lives, but when they're on

their game, they're great MCs. Game recognize game.
