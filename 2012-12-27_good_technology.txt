Good technology

My electric toothbrush is good technology.

It has one button. The button turns it on. It vibrates for 30 seconds, buzzes, then repeats three more times. It has no other controls.

It works one way: the standard, ADA recommended way. That's what most people want. If I want to brush longer, I restart it when it's done. If I want to stop early, I press the button again.

It has one display, a LED battery indicator. The LED has three parts: low, medium, high. The only other way it communicates is by buzzing.

It serves a purpose. Its ultrasonic vibrations clean my teeth better than manual brushing. It's also easier to reach every tooth surface when I'm not physically brushing.

It is not configurable. It has no screen. It is not smart. It has no WiFi or Bluetooth. It has no app. It is not a platform. All it has is one button, one LED, and one mode of operation.

My electric toothbrush is good technology. More technology should be good technology.
