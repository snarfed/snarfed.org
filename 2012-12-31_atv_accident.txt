<i>Artist's rendition. Not my actual wreck.</i>

I was in an unexpected accident over the holiday break.
[Like last year](/arizona_christmas), Gina and I went out with her brother and
father to ride ATVs and shoot guns. Unlike last year, I rolled one of the ATVs
and landed upside down, on my head, with the ATV on top of me. I'd accidentally
picked a fight with a half ton of steel and rubber, and I lost big time.

It was definitely my fault. I'd been driving a
[side by side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_by_Side_%28UTV%29), with way
better handling and grip, and I wasn't careful enough on the ATV. Most of the
turns had embankments on the outside, but I picked one with a six foot ditch
instead. Going into the turn, I felt the ATV understeer and lose grip, and I
managed to brake to almost a complete stop, but didn't quite keep it on the
trail. I rocked, then neatly [highsided](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highside),
fell into the ditch, and landed directly on my head.

I ended up upside down with my head pinned between the handlebars and a rock. I
tried to pull myself out, but I was stuck. Shit. Deep breath, tried again, no
luck. I tried to push the ATV up with a leg, then both legs. Still no luck. I
paused to catch my breath and reassess. Yup, still stuck. I pushed again, my
heart pumping enough adrenaline this time to wriggle my head out. I was free.

I scrambled to my feet, shaky and unsteady and bloodied all over. I wiggled my
toes, then my fingers, then - gingerly - my neck and head. Everything checked
out. Probably no neck or spinal damage. Phew.

My next thought was concussion. I closed one eye, then the other. My vision was
ok. I wasn't nauseous or dizzy. I hadn't lost consciousness. Did I remember
where I was? What I was doing? What day it was? Yes, yes, yes.

I probed my head and face where they'd landed on the rocks, feeling for the
sharp pain of a broken bone. I was raw and sore, but couldn't find any sharp
pains. My cheek and upper right teeth were a bit numb, but otherwise I'd escaped
with just scrapes and bruises. Thank God for that helmet and good old fashioned
luck!

Gina's dad found me, checked me out, and sped off to grab Gina and her brother.
We packed some ice onto my face, rode back to the trucks, loaded the ATVs, and
drove home.

Everything still seemed ok when we got there, so we figured I'd caught a
massively lucky break. We checked out my face again, and as they poked and
prodded, I started to notice little taps, then clicks, then a tiny but distinct
crunch. Hrm. Not good signs. Reluctantly, I agreed to go to the hospital to get
an X-ray.

An hour in the hospital waiting room, another hour to get a
[CT scan](/2010-11-17_ct_scan), yet another hour for the radiologist to read the
results. I still thought I was fine, but when the doctor finally arrived, he
told me I had not one but a raft of broken bones across the right side of my
face, many twisted far out of place. Well, shit, didn't see that coming.

He didn't know if I'd need surgery, so he arranged for a transfer to a nearby
trauma center. The EMTs arrived, strapped me to a gurney, and stuck an IV in my
arm, my first ever. Flat on my back and immobilized, they rolled me through
halls I'd walked down just hours before, my first stretcher ride of many to
come.

When I arrived, a team of ER doctors greeted me with a flurry of activity. When
they realized I wasn't dying, they drifted away, leaving me to more waiting,
more CT scans, and a proper room where I'd stay for the night (another first).

A nurse took my vital signs and informed me that since I was potentially pre-op,
I couldn't eat or drink anything, even water. It was midnight, almost ten hours
since the accident, and I was dying for water. Instead, they plugged me into
fluids, which did nothing for my thirst.

The night passed in a blur of tangled IV cords and too-small sheets, reading and
texting in fits and starts, peeing in a cup, and endless blood pressure cuffs
and thermometers. The one silver lining was that it didn't hurt - it never had,
really - so I turned down all the pain meds. (I don't like medication.)

The next morning, a nurse told me to go to the bathroom and wash with Hibiclens
to prepare for surgery. Uh, what? Surgery? Yes, surgery. I said thanks for the
offer, but this was elective surgery, and I wasn't about to do it without a lot
more research.

The [surgeon](http://www.jcl.com/news/reconstructive-surgery) arrived soon
after, looking nonplussed. He said it was
[semi-elective](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_surgery), in his opinion,
but he explained the situation, showed me the raw scans, and happily agreed to
bump me to a later slot so I could do some research. I asked about his success
and infection rates, and he said they were 100% and 0%, respectively. Seemed too
good to be true. I asked if we could do it with local anasthetic instead of
general, and he just laughed.

I read up on him and the procedure, talked to Gina and my family, and considered
the options. My cheekbone was broken all over and pushed into my sinus cavity,
destroying what [little sinus capacity](/2011-07-01_health_stuff) I had to begin
with. My eye socket was broken at the top, side, and bottom. Left alone, my
eyeball would gradually sink and I'd start to see double and lose vision.

The fix was to go in, realign the bones, and attach them with titanium screws
and a small plate so they'd stay in place. I wasn't happy about it, but none of
the alternatives made sense. I was going to have surgery. Ugh.

Gina had been back and forth between the hospital and home, and she sat down
with me to write a quick power of attorney, a DNR, and living will. We were
overreacting a bit, but I'd never had surgery before and I was nervous. She was
too.

The waiting was interminable. They finally wheeled me away, on my back again,
only to leave me in the pre-op staging area for another hour. When my
anasthesiologist arrived, I told her about my high metabolism and tolerance and
asked her to skip the morphine. She laughed as she fed the general anasthetic
into my IV.

When I woke up, the surgeon floated into my tunnel vision and said the operation
was "perfect." I thought, through the fog, that I'd had enough overstatement and
laughter from doctors.

Gina and her mom met me in my room, relieved and happy. I _still_ wasn't in
pain, but I was excited about drinking water again. That night passed in another
blur of nurses, tangled IVs and sheets, and peeing in a cup. Some things don't
change.

The next morning, I ate food for the first time in two days. Cream of wheat and
bad coffee never tasted so good. As I waited for my follow-up with the surgeon,
I gradually disconnected myself from the machines, put my street clothes back
on, walked around the floor, and annoyed the nurses. When he finally arrived to
check me out and discharge me, they were ecstatic.

Recovery has been straightforward. My job is just to reduce the inflammation
(ice and ibuprofen, the wonder drugs) and take a host of strong antiobiotics to
prevent infection. It's been a week since surgery, and the swelling is almost
gone. A week more and I might even wear contacts again.

I do notice the bones stretching and adjusting sometimes under pressure, when I
bite hard or try to open my mouth wide. They're settling, just like houses at
night. The nerve damage in my teeth will take a while longer to heal. Minor
complaints, though. All things considered, I was damn lucky.

And hey, there's even a silver lining. I can go through airport security with
the titanium screws and plate, but not [my mortal enemy](/2009-03-14_mri), the
MRI machine. I get a reprieve! It's CT scans for everything now.

I'm happy to be back to the land of the living. I wasn't excited about the
accident, the hospital stay, or the surgery, but I'm definitely happy I escaped
any major damage. Here's to counting blessings, and to a healthy New Year!
