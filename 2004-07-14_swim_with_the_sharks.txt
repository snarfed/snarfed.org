Swim with the Sharks

On Sunday morning, I woke up early (at 9am!) to go cheer for a friend who was
swimming in a race. Not an ordinary race, though...it was
[EnviroSport](http://envirosports.com/)'s
[Swim with the Sharks](http://www.envirosports.com/events/alcatraz-sharkfest)
event. Participants swam a mile and a half, from
[Alcatraz Island](http://www.nps.gov/alcatraz/) to shore, in the open waters of
the frigid San Francisco bay. It was a huge event; apart from the swimmers,
there were at least a few thousand spectators in the stands. It was a blast.

Kieran was the star of the show, though, so I'll let him describe it in his own
words.

> I finished the Alcatraz swim this morning, all limbs intact.
>
> I was advised not to look back at Alcatraz and keep looking forward. I was
> the last one into the water, out of 800. We spread out quickly and since I
> didn't really pass anyone for most of the swim I assumed I was in last place.
> In fact I was so concerned that I hadn't passed anyone I was afraid I was
> going to get pulled out of the water for being too slow. Every time one of
> the 50 or so Kayak rustlers got close I was afraid it was them telling me I
> wasn't going to qualify.
>
> As it turned out, fear is a great motivator and it got me across the bay
> quickly. Once I got to the entrance of the Aquatic Park I could see all the
> other swimmers yellow caps against retaining walls. I kicked it into high gear
> to try to catch up to them.
>
> I finished in just under an hour, which was faster than expected. When I got
> out of the water I turned around and saw a sea of yellow caps. People kept
> coming in for the next 30 minutes. I felt great and warm in the hot sun.
>
> Cheers, Kieran
