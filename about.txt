I'm based in San Francisco.

[snarfed.org](/) has been around [since early 2002](/snarfed_org_history). It was [born](/2003-07-18_its_live) on my own server, which lived first in dorm rooms at school and then in an apartment in San Francisco. It later [migrated](/2004-12-02_suburbia_ho) to a [Linux VPS](http://jvds.com/virtuozzo_linux.php) at [JVDS](http://jvds.com/), and finally to its [current home](/2006-08-23_virtual_housewarming) on a [shared FreeBSD server](http://pair.com/services/web_hosting/) at [pair.com](http://pair.com/).

On the software side, it started on [SnipSnap](http://snipsnap.org/), then [moved](/2006-08-23_virtual_housewarming) to [PyBlosxom](https://pyblosxom.github.io/), and [now runs](/2010-08-08_migrated_to_wordpress) on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), originally on [its own theme](/snarfed_wordpress_theme) and now on a [modified Ryu theme](/2013-06-16_redesigned). See my [software page](/software) for more of its custom patches, plugins, and themes.
