<p>Unpopular opinion: working from home is kind of awful.</p>



<p>I know, I know: the benefits of remote work and distributed teams, my privilege of being able to at all, I'm probably just doing it wrong, etc. Still. A month in, and it's not working great, either for me or my friends or colleagues. Can't wait to be back in the office.</p>
