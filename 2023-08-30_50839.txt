<p>If we restrict ourselves to online, are they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(protocol)#Finger_user_information_protocol">.plan files</a>? Usenet newsgroups? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBSes</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel">Minitel</a>? Comments in code on floppies passed around by mainframe programmers?</p>

<p>Or do we consider offline too? Christmas cards, phone trees, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamphlet_wars">17th century pamphlet wars</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_(gathering)">Salons</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostra">Roman speeches in the Forum</a>?<br><br>(I'm hoping not to rathole into definitions here, but for the sake of argument, let's say social networking is somewhere between private conversations and one to many, institutional broadcast. It's many to many, it includes relationships in some form, it's asynchronous or has some persistence over time, and it's public or at least broader than purely private closed groups.)</p>
