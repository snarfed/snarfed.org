Hi all! Well, I didn't plan it, but word got out anyway: [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/)'s Bluesky <=> fediverse support went online a couple weeks ago, quietly and without announcement, but people still found it. Over 1200 accounts have turned it on so far and bridged themselves one direction or the other. It's great to see so much early interest!

(For anyone unfamiliar with Bridgy Fed, [here's an introduction](/2023-11-27_re-introducing-bridgy-fed).)

It's still _very early_, and I wasn't quite prepared for this much volume this quickly. Expect lots of bugs, missing features, downtime, and other rough edges. [The docs are mostly up to date](https://fed.brid.gy/docs), at least. If you hit a problem, [search the open issues](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues), and if you don't see it there, feel free to file it.

Also, much of the current state is not final. Expect some design and policy choices to change. For example, right now you have to manually enable the bridge, but that may change eventually, at least for Bluesky accounts bridging into the fediverse.

Otherwise, there's a ton to do, and I'm only one person, doing this on the side, so progress will be slow. They say if you don't feel uncomfortable when you ship, you probably waited too long, so let me just say that I feel very uncomfortable right now, hopefully in a good way. ðŸ˜€ Thanks again for all the interest, and for your patience!
