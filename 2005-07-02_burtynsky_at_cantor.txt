Susan's new exhibit, [Manufactured Landscapes: The Photographs of Edward
Burtynsky](http://burtynsky.stanford.edu/), opened a couple days ago! I'm far
from an art expert, but if I were to crib from the site, I might say that
Burtynsky's photographs capture the uneasy relationship between natural and
manmade phenomena. In my own words, I'll just say that they're incredible...and
more than a little unsettling.

Susan has done exhibition work at [Cantor](http://ccva.stanford.edu/), on and
off, for a while now. She's currently wearing a curator's hat, and judging by
this exhibit alone, she's doing a phenomenal job. I can't wait to see it!
