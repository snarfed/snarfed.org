Wow. It's been a long few weeks since I last posted. I've spent almost all of it
working my butt off. It's been stressful, and I miss coding, and I have lots of
sleep debt to pay off...but my team is making good progress on our project, and
there's light at the end of the tunnel.

In between pushes, integrations, and firefighting, I still managed to get out a
little. I went down to LA a couple weekends ago to visit friends, family, and
generally party in fine style. I took my grandparents to a
[concert](http://www.calphil.org/new/pages_fotg/newsummer2004.html) at the
[Arcadia Arboretum](http://arboretum.org/), less than a mile from the house I
grew up in. I visited my house, my high school, my elementary school, my church,
and of course, the [In-N-Out](http://in-n-out.com/) just a five minute bike ride
away. Yay memories...

I also met up with lots of friends I don't see often enough, including
[Nicky](http://greendotpublicschools.org/contact/),
[Charlie](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csharp/),
[Maureen](http://www.stanford.edu/~mdragan/), and
[Sam](/sam_z_glassenberg) and crew for his [globetrotting 24th birthday
party](/twentyfour.gif). Four parties in four cities in
four nights, Tel Aviv to Chicago to Seattle to LA! Props to Sam. He's
ridiculous, and he always throws great parties.

I spent most of this past weekend in San Francisco at [Love
Parade](http://loveparadesf.com/), [Paul van Dyk](http://1015.com/pvd.htm), and
[Folsom Street Fair](http://folsomstreetfair.com/). Think amusement park meets
rave, then sprinkle in hundreds of thousands of people. The fairs were great,
but I was most psyched to see Paul van Dyk, even though we had to brave
[1015](http://1015.com/) to do it. He's probably one of the
[top](http://johndigweed.com/) [three](http://pauloakenfold.com/)
[DJs](http://paulvandyk.de/) in the world, so I was really excited to see him
spin in person. His set lasted for over three hours, and it was incredible. I
don't often hear really good trance or house live, so it was worth fighting
through the club kid scene and staying out until 7am. I can't wait to find some
free time to dig through the message boards and find the songs he played that I
hadn't heard before.

For now, it's back to work for a couple weeks...and then off to Hong Kong on
vacation! Not that I could have picked a worse time to leave work, but we've
been planning it for a while, and there's no way I'd cancel it. Plus, I've never
been anywhere on the Asian continent before, and I'm going with
[Walter](/gallery/hong_kong_2005/barefoot_ryan_walter.jpg),
who I've known forever, and who just happens to be from Hong Kong. It's shaping
up to be a great trip.
