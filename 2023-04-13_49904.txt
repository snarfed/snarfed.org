<p>More and more these days, when I mindlessly grab my phone, I'm not finding anything in the dopamine drip feeds. Email, messages, socials, blogs, Slacks, news...all empty, unless it's been hours.</p>

<p>I think this is good? A sign that <a href="https://snarfed.org/2013-05-31_fighting-information-overload-and-beyond">I'm gradually dialing it in and pruning down to just stuff I actually consciously choose</a>, which turns out to be not much, and not often? I don't feel like I'm missing a lot, if anything, so that's encouraging.</p>
