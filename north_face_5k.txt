North Face 5K

[Jeremy](http://www.facebook.com/cotter) and I ran in the
[North Face Endurance Challenge](http://www2.thenorthface.com/endurancechallenge/)
5K this year at
[Fort Baker](http://www.parksconservancy.org/visit/park-sites/fort-baker.html),
just west of Sausalito and the Golden Gate Bridge. The route was mostly trail,
with some mild elevation. I ran it in 22 minutes, roughly 7:00 mile pace. The
event also hosted 10k, half and full marathon, 50k, and 50 mile events. Next
time I'll have to do at least the 10k!
