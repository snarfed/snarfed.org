I'm pleased to announce [Color Data](https://data.color.com/) today! It's a public research database of aggregated genetic and clinical health information from 50,000 individuals who took a [Color](https://www.color.com/) test and opted to share their data with research.

Building Color Data was some of the most fun I've had at Color since I joined. We've been using it internally and with partners for a while now, so I'm very excited to share it with the world. We're [announcing it at ASHG in San Diego today](http://www.ashg.org/2018meeting/asp/soe/webroot/soe.shtml#/sess886), and the [early press](https://www.genomeweb.com/cancer/color-unveils-public-repository-variant-clinical-data-50000-customers-ashg-meeting) (GenomeWeb) is very positive. [Try it out!](https://data.color.com/v1/)
