<p>I tried something inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cantrill">Bryan Cantrill</a>'s seminal <a href="https://archive.org/details/vimeo-230142234"><em>Platform as a Reflection of Values</em></a> and <a href="https://fed.brid.gy/docs#values">took a stab at enumerating Bridgy Fed's product and engineering values</a>.</p>

<p>Bryan has said that sometimes (often?) you don't know your own project's values, at least up front, and boy did that land here. Definitely a valuable exercise. Feedback is welcome!</p>
