Hi all! Time for another regular (ish) [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) status update, with big news: we're bridging web sites to Bluesky!

[We've supported this on the fediverse for a while](/2024-01-09_51810), and we're now doing it for Bluesky too. You can use Bridgy Fed to automatically generate a Bluesky presence for your web site, and you can follow any site that has microformats2 or an RSS or Atom feed. Bridgy Fed extracts profile info, converts blog posts to Bluesky posts, etc.

As examples, check out [Nature](https://bsky.app/profile/nature.com.web.brid.gy) and [Electrek](https://bsky.app/profile/electrek.co.web.brid.gy). To get started, [enter a web site here](https://fed.brid.gy/#enter-web-site).

Beyond that, lots more happened over the last few weeks:
