The Giz

A couple of my friends got married recently - congratulations, Matt and Kristin! -
and they asked me to cat-sit for them while they were on their honeymoon. They
know I love dogs and cats, including theirs, [Gizmo](/cats), so they
thought I'd be a good catsitter. I don't know if I was a _good_ catsitter, but I
did have a lot of fun. I love seeing [my family's cats](/cats) when I go
home, and I got to hang out with Gizmo every day while Matt and Kristin were
gone, so I was in pet heaven.

They got back a few days ago, and I already miss "the Giz," but I'm definitely
glad to see them again. I wish I could get a cat or dog, but it wouldn't be the
best life for a pet. They'd be cooped up in a little apartment all day, and I'd
see them for a couple hours, at most, every other day or so. Someday, though!
