[Referrer spam](http://www.spywareinfo.com/articles/referer_spam/) - or by Apache's original misspelling, _referer_ spam - was a problem at snarfed.org for years. I ~use~ used to use [Summary](http://summary.net/) for web analytics, and I made its statistic pages publicly available for a while, so spammers hit this site with fake referrers, hoping that they'll be linked from the Summary pages.

There are a number of approaches to fighting referrer spam, but so far, no silver bullet. Here's what I did while my Summary output was online.

* I maintained a hand-edited blacklist of known spammers' sites in my `summary.conf` file. It's far from ideal, but it worked. If you're fighting referrer spam, feel free to borrow it. I used to use [webalizer](http://webalizer.com/), and did the same in `webalizer.conf`.

* I wrote a [webalizer nofollow patch](/webalizer_nofollow_patch) that adds support for the popular new [nofollow](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html) tag.

* For a bit, I used [iptables](http://www.google.com/url?sa=X&start=1&q=http://www.netfilter.org/) to blacklist known spammers' IP addresses and subnets, such as marketscore.com, bezeqint.net, and ac.at.

* I liked existing blacklist and referrer spam tools, such as [Jay Allen's](http://www.jayallen.org/) [MT-Blacklist](http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/). However, most of those tools are specific to [MovableType](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/) and [Apache](http://apache.org/), and this site uses [SnipSnap](/SnipSnap) instead.

* A better approach would be to write tools that operate directly on referrer logs, so they can be used with any web server or CMS and any web analytics package. [Tony Buser](http://juju.org/)'s [derefspam.pl](http://www.juju.org/archives/2005/01/21/derefspam) script is a good first step. You could extend it to use DNSBLs and RBLs like [Spamhaus](http://www.spamhaus.org/xbl/index.lasso), [BSB](http://bsb.empty.us/), [Blitzed](http://opm.blitzed.org/info), and [SURBL](http://www.surbl.org/faq.html).
