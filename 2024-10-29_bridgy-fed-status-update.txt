Hi [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) fans! It's time for another status update, headlined by two big new features.

First, [you can now use custom domain handles on accounts bridged into Bluesky](https://fed.brid.gy/docs#bluesky-enhanced)! Web sites and fediverse accounts can both do this; click through for instructions. [Here's an example.](https://bsky.app/profile/fedi.test.snarfed.org) We've been excited about this for a while, we hope it makes bridged accounts feel a bit more like first class citizens.

Second, if you deactivate bridging to Bluesky, [you can now undo it and bring back your bridged account](https://fed.brid.gy/docs#opt-out)! Just un-block and re-follow the bot, or for a web site, [file an issue](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues) or [ping me](https://fed.brid.gy/docs#opt-out). This is supported if you first deactivated after 2024-10-22; we're still working on the rest.

I'm also excited that [Tamschi](https://github.com/Tamschi) has generously volunteered to help triage issues and coordinate development. He's been a valuable presence on the project for a while now. Please give him a warm welcome!

Oh, and I got distracted for a bit and [built a labeler that emits custom self-labels](https://github.com/snarfed/self-labeler), then [promptly realized that custom self-labels probably aren't allowed](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions/2885#discussioncomment-11009285), even though [Bridgy Fed has been using them since launch](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/827). Ah well!
