Pub Crawl

Pictures from a standard night out with Derek, Alexis, Kristina, and other
friends. We started at
[Rosewood](http://www.rosewoodbar.com/) and ended up at
[Impala](http://www.impalasf.com/).
Ah, North Beach. :P

The pictures are from
[Derek's Picasa album](http://picasaweb.google.com/Derekthelifeguard/PubCrawl).
Thanks, Derek!
