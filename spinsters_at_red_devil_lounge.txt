Spinsters at Red Devil Lounge

The [SF Spinsters](http://sfspinsters.com/) held their [2006 winter charity event](http://sfspinsters.com/calendar.php) at the [Red Devil Lounge](http://www.reddevillounge.com/mainpage.htm). I went in spite of the theme - '80s, argh - but the band was great, and lots of the guests went all out with their costumes. Peter, Caroline, and her roommates took these pictures before they left.
