Context on the [Wuhan coronavirus outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak):

* [H5N1: 375 deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1)
* [SARS: ~800 deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome#Epidemiology)
* [MERS: 858 deaths](https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/)
* [H1N1: 151-579k deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic)
* ["normal" flu: *290-650k deaths each year*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)

Coronavirus is absolutely still a tragedy, and worth every effort to contain, but fortunately doesn't seem to warrant all the panic or fear-mongering.
