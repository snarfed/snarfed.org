Should first sale doctrine die?

<p class="right"><img src="/cds.jpg" /></p>

[First sale doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_sale_doctrine) - your
legal right in the US to sell a book, movie, CD, or game that you own - has
never really made sense to me. It implies that a piece of media is a
[durable good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_good), which means its value
doesn't get used up over time and doesn't depend on its owner. For most media,
though, that just seems plain wrong.

The classic example of a durable good is the car. Assuming routine maintenance,
the lifespan of a modern car is
[over 100,000 miles](http://autos.aol.com/article/high-mileage-driving/), or
roughly five to fifteen years. Cars are also
[rivalrous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_(economics)), ie only useful to
one owner at a time, but it generally doesn't matter who the owner is. A car is
just as useful to anyone who can and will drive it.

Media is different. Personally, after I've read a book or watched a movie or
played a game a few times, I feel like I've gotten most of the value I'm going
to get from it. I'd replay some games and reread some books, but not many, and
even then, the marginal value gets pretty damn low after the first few times.

This doesn't apply across the board, of course. People happily replay music for
years, or even decades. Still, most media seems like a consumable in that I can
use it up...but the catch is I only use it up _for me_. If I sell it to someone
who hasn't played it yet, it's still brimming with value for them. This makes it
a kind of virtual, _owner-dependent_
[consumable good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumables).

Economics and property law aren't as comfortable with this as they are with
straightforward durable and consumable goods, and first sale doctrine is the
clearest example I know of.

We generally want laws to encourage good things and discourage bad things. In
this case, if someone derives value from a piece of media, we want the creator
of that work to be compensated. Basic market economics.

Given that, if media is an owner-dependent consumable, first sale doctrine seems
unfair. People can keep reselling a single copy indefinitely, each one
extracting the lion's share of the value without compensating the creator or
publisher. The
[used games debate](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3872/as_recession_deepens_used_games_.php)
is only the latest incarnation of this. The whole thing just seems broken, and I
don't see a benefit we get in exchange.

(I don't consider cheap used media a benefit. Sure, media prices are probably
artificially inflated right now, due to lost sales and the added potential
resale value. If used markets disappeared, theoretically those prices should
come back down. That would mean less revenue, but publishers and creators would
capture all of it, instead of losing a chunk to
[unhelpful middlemen](http://www.gamestop.com/tradeins). That's a win in my book.)

I know this makes me sound anti-consumer, but I'm not, honest! I do think the
current system is a bit anti-creator, though, which is just as bad.

It's worth noting that most media is out of print and not currently sold. First
sale doctrine enables used markets, which make it possible to buy and experience
that media legally. I see that as an argument for better distribution and
archive access, though, not a direct argument for first sale doctrine per se.

Happily, digital distribution is already addressing this. Online stores have big
back catalogs of "out of print" music, movies, ebooks, and games you can buy and
play right now, and that will only grow over time.

More importantly, digital distribution points the way forward. When you buy a
piece of digital media, instead of a physical artifact, you get a license, which
isn't bound by property law or first sale doctrine at all. It's another example
of technology gracefully working around outdated laws.

Interestingly, first sale doctrine is just a US thing. Does it need reform?
Should we adopt the European
_[droit de suite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droit_de_suite)_ model? Can we
let it quietly fade away, obsoleted by digital distribution? Or am I off base
entirely? I don't know, but it will definitely be interesting to watch and see!
