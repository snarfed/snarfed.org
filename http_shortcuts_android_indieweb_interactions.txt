I've been experimenting recently to see how seamless I can make [IndieWeb](https://indiemap.org/) interactions - replying, liking, reposting, following - on my phone. Silos have these down to a single tap each, which I haven't quite achieved, but I have it down to three, and the network request happens in the background so there's no visible delay. Progress!

The use case is, I'm looking at a post on the web or the [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), in my [social reader](https://indieweb.org/social_reader) or browser, and I want to reply. Or like, or repost. Or I'm looking at someone's profile, and I want to follow them. I'm doing this IndieWeb style, so I want to post these here, on my web site, with the appropriate [tag](https://indieweb.org/tags) and [syndication target(s)](https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/#syndication-targets), and let webmentions propagate them out. And I want it as quick and simple as possible. Very few taps, minimal delays.

Ideally these interactions would be built into my reader or a [Micropub](https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/) app, which are often the same thing. That has definitely happened! But current [Android social readers](https://indieweb.org/social_reader#Indigenous) [and Micropub apps](https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients) aren't well maintained. [There's hope, and renewed interest](https://marksuth.dev/posts/2023/04/indiepass-update-april-2023), which is great, but I want something now. I also often want to respond to things _outside_ my reader, not just inside it.

 The standard way to do this is a share target that either opens an app or, ideally, performs the interaction directly. Remember, minimal taps. Navigating inside an app is a non-starter. Same with manually entering tags or toggling syndication targets. The silo gold standard is a single tap and immediate response. Aspirational!

I ended up making my own share targets with [Roland Meyer](https://www.rmy.ch/en/)'s [HTTP Shortcuts app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.rmy.android.http_shortcuts). I had to construct raw Micropub HTTP requests in its UI, including auth token, content, tag, and syndication target, which took a bit of work, but the end result is exactly what I want. Three taps to like. Same for reply, repost, and follow. It even has a built in text input pop-up for composing replies. Slick!

Screenshots below. [Here's my config.](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/main/http_shortcuts_android.json) Import it into the app, fill in your site's Micropub endpoint and auth token in each shortcut, and you should be good to go.

Hopefully, this is all temporary. [Mark Sutherland](https://marksuth.dev/) has [started working on Indigenous/IndiePass](https://marksuth.dev/posts/2023/04/indiepass-update-april-2023) again, and I'd love to switch to using that, or a similar proper Micropub app, once there's one that [works](https://github.com/marksuth/indigenous-android/issues/430) [for me](https://github.com/marksuth/indigenous-android/issues/431). Until then, though, I'm happy with this.
