Bridgy Fed status update

Another brief [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) progress report: [first pass at Bluesky support](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/381) is feature complete! All basic interactions - user discovery, following, posts, replies, likes, reposts - are working in both directions. The last bit I got working this week was posts flowing from Bluesky to the fediverse and replies, likes, and reposts flowing back. Screenshots below.

Disclaimer! As usual. This is only in the [federation sandbox](https://atproto.com/blog/federation-developer-sandbox), not production [bsky.app](https://bsky.app/). I have lots more work to do on outreach, safeguards, incorporating feedback, etc before this launches for real users, not to mention that it depends on Bluesky themselves enabling federation.

Next up, lots more bug fixes and cleanup, and I badly need to redesign the home page and UI for Bridgy Fed's shiny new multi-protocol future. If you're a UX designer and this sounds interesting, please get in touch! I'd dearly love help from someone who actually knows what they're doing. ðŸ˜†

Otherwise, feedback is welcome, as always!
