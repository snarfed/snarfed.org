Brid.gy, meet Webmentions

[Brid.gy](http://brid.gy/), one of my side projects,
<a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed">backfeeds</a> comments on social
networks to web pages linked in the posts. It only supported WordPress
[when I launched it](/2012-01-08_bridgy_launched) a couple years ago, but I've
been making some changes, and it now sends
[webmentions](http://www.webmention.org/) instead, which are supported in
[lots of servers](http://indiewebcamp.com/webmention#Implementations). I also
added Instagram, made a bunch of smaller improvements, and updated the look and
feel. Check out
[this example of backfed comments](/2013-12-07_goodbye-penny-arcade-report#comments),
then feel free to [try it out](http://brid.gy/) yourself!

The update was inspired by the [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) community,
who have been doing all sorts of great work around making personal web sites a
viable alternative to social network profiles. Thanks all!
