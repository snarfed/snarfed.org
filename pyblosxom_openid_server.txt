For the impatient:  
&nbsp; Download [openid_server.py](/openid_server.py) or
[openid_server-0.4.tar.gz](/openid_server-0.4.tar.gz)  
&nbsp; [OpenID home page](http://openid.net/)  
&nbsp; [PyBlosxom home page](https://pyblosxom.github.io/)  

[openid_server.py](/openid_server.py) is a
[PyBlosxom](https://pyblosxom.github.io/) plugin that implements
[OpenID](http://openid.net/) 1.x and 2.0. OpenID is a distributed authentication
protocol, ie a single sign on platform, that uses URLs as identifiers. If you
have a PyBlosxom site, this plugin allows you to login anywhere that accepts
OpenID.

This plugin also implements the
[Simple Registration
Extension](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/simple-registration-extension),
which lets you optionally provide your name, email address, and other
information automatically to sites that you log into with OpenID.

In OpenID terminology, this plugin acts as an an 
[Identifer](http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-1_1.html#anchor2) and
[Identity Provider](http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-1_1.html#anchor2).
It provides an
[endpoint URL](http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-1_1.html#anchor2),
handles OpenID requests on that endpoint, allows
[associations](http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-1_1.html#mode_associate),
and authenticates the user with an HTML form.

To use it, first download and install the
[Python OpenID libraries](http://www.openidenabled.com/python-openid/).
Then, download [openid_server.py](/openid_server.py) and
place it in your plugins directory. Finally, add this line to your flavour's
head template:

    <link rel="openid.server"
          href="$base_url$openid_trigger">

If you want to use SSL, hard-code your base url, like so:

    <link rel="openid.server"
          href="https://snarfed.org$openid_trigger">

Finally, add the `openid_password` (required) and `openid_trigger` (optional)
config variables to your `config.py`:

    py['openid_password'] = 'topsecret!'
    py['openid_trigger'] = '/openid'

Et voila! You should be good to go. Try it out on a friendly neighborhood
OpenID-enabled blog near you, like maybe
[Scott Kveton](http://kveton.com/blog/)'s.

You can also provide your name, email address, and other information to sites
that you log into with OpenID, using the
[Simple Registration
Extension](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/simple-registration-extension).
Just fill in any of these config variables in `config.py`:

    py['openid_nickname'] = 'ryan'
    py['openid_email'] = 'ryan'
    py['openid_fullname'] = 'Ryan Barrett'
    py['openid_dob'] = '1901-01-01'
    py['openid_gender'] = 'M'
    py['openid_postcode'] = '90001'
    py['openid_country'] = 'US'
    py['openid_language'] = 'EN-us'
    py['openid_timezone'] = 'America/Los_Angeles'

Default HTML is included for the endpoint, login, and error pages. For your
CSS styling pleasure, it uses divs with the classes `openid-info`,
`openid-login`, and `openid-error`.

You can override the default HTML by adding `openid-info`, `openid-login`, and
`openid-error` templates for your flavour of choice. Example templates for the
html flavour are included in
[openid_server-0.4.tar.gz](/openid_server-0.4.tar.gz).
