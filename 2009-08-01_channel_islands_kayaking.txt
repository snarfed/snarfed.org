Last weekend
[Ken](http://facebook.com/kashcraft),
[Peter](http://facebook.com/profile.php?id=205998),
[Jeremy](http://facebook.com/cotter),
and I went
[ocean kayaking](https://www.kayaksb.com/trips/santacruz.asp?EventID=1450)
and camping in the
[Channel Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_of_California),
on Santa Cruz Island. We only took a three day weekend, but it was a great
break from everything, and a lot of fun.

The kayaking itself was exciting. Much of it was inside sea caves that water
had slowly worn away over thousands of years. The caves themselves were
beautiful, and perfect for exploring, but the tides meant that the water level
constantly changed, suddenly and unpredictably. It was an adrenaline rush.
