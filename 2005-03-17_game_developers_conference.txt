I just got back from [GDC](http://gdconf.com/), and now that I'm finally caught
up on sleep debt, I've briefly [written up some of the
highlights](/GDC_2005).

As always, GDC was overwhelmingly fun. I saw amazing demos, heard
thought-provoking talks from inspiring people, and of course, partied way too
much. It's also very involving, and I definitely got swept up in current
industry issues like [quality of life](http://www.igda.org/qol/) and
[skyrocketing budgets](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=7225).

However, one of the best parts of this year's GDC didn't have to do with games
at all. Games just provided the excuse to hang out with a
[few](http://mmandel.com/) [good](http://samzglassenberg.com/)
[friends](http://derelictsands.com/). We don't get to hang out nearly enough,
since they don't live in the area, so we had a lot of fun. LucasArts kids tear
it up!
