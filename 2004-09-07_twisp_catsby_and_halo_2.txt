Last weekend, [Maulik](/Maulik) and I went to [Penny Arcade Expo
2004](http://penny-arcade.com/pax/), in Seattle. We hung out with
[Sam](/sam_z_glassenberg) and hit the nightlife, but mostly we just
played lots of video games. :P [More pictures here.](/pax_2004)

Penny Arcade Expo, or PAX, is a game conference organized by the authors of
[Penny Arcade](http://penny-arcade.com/). (If you don't read Penny Arcade - you
[heathen](http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php3?date=1999-11-19&res=l)! - read
Maulik's [quick
intro](http://maulik.freeshell.net/Miki.pl?page=Penny+Arcade+Greats.miki).) They
created their own conference because, in their words, "there was an event we
wanted to go to that did not yet exist." I was skeptical, but they turned out to
be right - PAX combined elements of [E3](http://e3expo.com/),
[GDC](http://gdconf.com/), [Comicon](http://www.comicon.com/), playing xbox with
your buddies, playing [D&D](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/) or
[Magic](http://www.wizards.com/magic/) with your buddies, and even watching
movies.

The unifying theme, of course, was [games](/games). This was perfect for
Maulik and me - we've spent vast amounts of our lives playing different video
games, and we still intensely follow gaming culture and news, but we don't have
nearly as much free time to _play_ games any more. So an event like this, where
we could totally immerse ourselves in games for a weekend, was perfect.

Not to mention that we got to play Halo 2, Fable, Soul Calibur, Doom 3, UT2K4,
DDR Revolution Extreme, Matrix Online, and, uh, Nibbles. :P
