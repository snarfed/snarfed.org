All the recent Twitter drama has sparked renewed interest in [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) and the [fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse) and even [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/), my little [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) side project that turns personal web sites into full-fledged fediverse accounts.

A month and a half ago, I was all set to take it easy, maybe play [a game](https://halfmermaid.co/) [or two](https://jumpship.co.uk/), and [poke at a new project](https://atproto.com/docs). Then, Musk happened. A ridiculous mess, to be sure, but also a huge opportunity for fediverse projects like Bridgy Fed.

Except, it wasn't ready. It worked, mostly, but it was rough. Very rough. Onboarding was especially bad: the home page was a wall of text, and there was no UI to speak of. If I wanted to capitalize on all the newfound interest, I had work to do.

So, I rolled up my sleeves and got building. I started with my own web site: I'd hooked it up to Bridgy Fed a long time ago, but I wasn't really using it. I dove in, [scratched my own itches](https://indieweb.org/scratch_your_own_itch), listened to early users and new refugees, and scratched their itches too. I built actual, honest to God UI and an onboarding flow. [I added features, tracked down interop issues, and fixed lots of bugs.](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) I watched the dozens of active users turn into hundreds and traffic swell 10x over the course of just a few weeks.

It's been a hell of a sprint. I'm slowing down now, but at this point I can say I'm using this web site to fully participate in the fediverse, with complete posting, reading, and responding experiences [on both desktop and phone](https://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb-press-this/). No Mastodon instance needed.

If that sounds interesting, [try it out](https://fed.brid.gy/) and let me know what you think. Feedback is welcome. Happy federating!
