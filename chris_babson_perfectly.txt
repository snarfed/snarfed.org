Chris Babson - Perfectly

<p class="right"><img class="shadow" src="/chris_babson_bw.jpg" /></p>

[Chris Babson](http://www.soundclick.com/artist/8/chrisbabson.htm), a friend from college, recently released his first CD, [Perfectly](http://www.freedb.org/freedb_search_fmt.php?cat=rock&id=77077208). Chris has been singing in theater and musicals for a while, but he's only recently started songwriting. Even so, the CD is startlingly good. Chris considers [Jason Mraz](http://jasonmraz.com/), [Marc Broussard](http://www.islandrecords.com/marcbroussard/site/home.las), and [Martin Sexton](http://www.martinsexton.com/) among his influences, but he's definitely developed his own voice.

I heard Chris play live well before I heard him recorded, and he's a blast in person. Even alone, armed with nothing more than a mic and an acoustic guitar, Chris overflows with personality. His shows are incredible, due mostly to his voice, his songwriting, and his larger-than-life stage presence.
