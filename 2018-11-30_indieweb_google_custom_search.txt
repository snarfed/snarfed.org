IndieWeb Google Custom Search Engine

_TL;DR: it exists! Try it below, [or here](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=001473925626342383772:izm-5gxypp4)._

<!-- Override styles that we don't want to apply to the google custom search box. -->
<style type="text/css">
.gsc-input, .entry-content td {
  border: 0 !important;
}
.gsc-input-box table {
  margin-bottom: 0 !important;
}
</style>

    var cx = '001473925626342383772:izm-5gxypp4';
    var gcse = document.createElement('script');
    gcse.type = 'text/javascript';
    gcse.async = true;
    gcse.src = 'https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=' + cx;

A search engine for the whole [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) has been a [hot conversation topic](https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2018/11/25/scoping-out-basics-of-indieweb-search), on and off, for many years now. Many of us offer [search](https://indieweb.org/search) on our own individual sites, and more ambitious projects like [cweiske](https://cweiske.de/)'s [phinde](https://cweiske.de/tagebuch/phinde.htm) can [search our IRC archives](http://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/), but building a full fledged search engine to crawl and index _all_ IndieWeb sites has always been a bit too big of a project to tackle. (Not to mention the question of [which sites we should include](https://indiemap.org/docs.html#sites) in the first place.)

As usual, my first instinct is always [software prevention](https://snarfed.org/2017-01-23_23351). Whatever the task at hand is, someone has else has usually already tried to do it. Often they've even succeeded, to some degree. Search is certainly no exception. Google has offered [custom search engines](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/) for individual sites for a long time, so I threw together one that searches all of the sites in [Indie Map](https://indiemap.org/), plus lots more that have joined the IndieWeb since then. It seems to work ok so far. [Try it out](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=001473925626342383772:izm-5gxypp4) and let me know what you think!

If you like it, you can use it in the future [from its dedicated page here](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=001473925626342383772:izm-5gxypp4), or you can embed it in any web page by adding this HTML:

```
<script>
  (function() {
    var cx = '001473925626342383772:izm-5gxypp4';
    var gcse = document.createElement('script');
    gcse.type = 'text/javascript';
    gcse.async = true;
    gcse.src = 'https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=' + cx;
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(gcse, s);
  })();
</script>
<gcse:searchbox-only></gcse:searchbox-only>
```
