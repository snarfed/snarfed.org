<p>I've been hearing and saying "don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good" a lot over the past few days.</p>



<p>The only way I know how to make something good is to ship and iterate. Get something usable out there, in front of yourself and eventually others, use it (read it etc), get feedback, revise. The early versions <em>will not be as good</em> as later versions. Resources and time are constrained, iteration is what makes it good, much more than the guess at a good v1. MVPs are imperfect and incomplete. That's ok! The sooner you ship and iterate, the sooner it gets better.</p>



<p>First impressions are one caveat. You only get one chance at them! Look hard at what truly matters in a first impression, be clear eyed about the tradeoffs, make decisions, and ship the MVP. Most people won't see it anyway, but if you iterate and improve, they may eventually see a later, better version.</p>



<p>Onward.</p>
