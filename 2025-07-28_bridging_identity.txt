One of the most common questions we get here is, "can you help me connect all my different accounts?" You're on Bluesky, and Instagram, and Mastodon, you make a video series on YouTube, you have a blog, sometimes you post on Reddit, and a while back you set up a Linktree to connect them all. Half of your accounts are inactive, the other half you copy and paste between all the time. At least once a day, you open a notification in one place, only to end up in a different place altogether, with no way to connect the two.

There must be a better way, right?

We hope so! It's a big, gnarly, multi-faceted problem. We ran a session on it [at FediForum, back in June,](https://fediforum.org/2025-06/) and came away with a [great set of draft user stories and future directions](https://fediforum.org/2025-06/session/7-b/). Today, we want to focus on one technique we've been using in [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) and [Bounce](https://blog.anew.social/bounce-a-cross-protocol-migration-tool/): _account links_.

Often, when people think about consolidating their identities online, they think top-down. If the problem is too many different accounts, one obvious solution is to make a new, meta account that knows them all and connects them all together, right?

It's a good thought! FriendFeed, Plaxo, Linktree, HootSuite, and countless other [social network aggregators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_aggregation) have taken a swing at it over the years, many still to this day. The catch is, this just crowns a new central authority, with control over all of your accounts. It might work, but here in the open social web, we tend to prefer things less centralized. With apologies to [David Clark](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_D._Clark#Sourced) and the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/): _We reject kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in rough consensus and running code._

</p>

The natural next step is to take this meta account service and turn it into an open standard. A noble, worthy idea! WebFinger, DIDs, OpenID, PGP keyservers, and many others had the same idea. Enter [XKCD 927](https://xkcd.com/927/).

So if thinking top down can lead to over-centralization and over-standardization, we wondered about the other direction. What's the smallest thing we could do, bottom up, without introducing another central authority or standard? We immediately thought of profile links. Many social networks let you include links in your profile: your web site, Linktree, Patreon, etc. These are aimed at human users, but we knew that there were machine-readable corollaries: places in each account's underlying data where they can _link to other accounts_, on other networks. The web has [`rel=me`](https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-me), the fediverse has [`alsoKnownAs`](https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#did-core), Bluesky also uses [`alsoKnownAs`](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#dfn-alsoknownas) (also check out their 2022 [Satellite contest](https://web.archive.org/web/20220319151052/https://blueskyweb.org/blog/satellite)), and Nostr has [NIP-39](https://nips.nostr.com/39). (We're not sure about Farcaster yet. If you know how, [please let us know](mailto:letsbuild@anew.social)!)

Let's look at an example. [Anuj](https://quillmatiq.com/) is [@quillmatiq@pixelfed.social](https://pixelfed.social/quillmatiq) on Pixelfed. That account is [bridged to Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/quillmatiq.pixelfed.social.ap.brid.gy) by Bridgy Fed, which _publishes an account link_ back to the Pixelfed account [in the Bluesky account's DID document](https://web.plc.directory/did/did:plc:3qp6hiiqwuzasese2vtex6xl), via `alsoKnownAs`:

```json
  "alsoKnownAs": [
    "at://pixels.quillmatiq.com",
    "https://pixelfed.social/users/quillmatiq"
  ]
```

The second element there, <code>https://pixelfed.social/users/quillmatiq</code>, is the Pixelfed account's ActivityPub actor id. Any Bluesky client or app can read this DID document, fetch <code>https://pixelfed.social/users/quillmatiq</code>, see that it has a `link rel=alternate type=application/activity+json`, and use that to find and show the Pixelfed account. Here's an example mockup based on bsky.app; note the Pixelfed logo and linked handle.

<a href="/bsky-pixelfed-quillmatiq-link.png"><img class="shadow" src="/bsky-pixelfed-quillmatiq-link.png"></a>

This works in both directions. [Anuj's Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/quillmatiq.com) is bridged to the fediverse, and [its bridged ActivityPub actor](https://browser.pub/@quillmatiq.com@bsky.brid.gy) includes this:

```json
"alsoKnownAs": ["at://did:plc:xgvzy7ni6ig6ievcbls5jaxe"]
```

Fediverse clients and apps can fetch [that DID document](https://web.plc.directory/did/did:plc:xgvzy7ni6ig6ievcbls5jaxe), see that it's a Bluesky account, and [link users to it](https://bsky.app/profile/quillmatiq.com). Bridgy Fed already even includes that user-visible link! Clients just need to match it to `alsoKnownAs`, detect that it's a Bluesky account, and show a visible indicator. Here's an example mockup, based on Mastodon's web UI.

<!-- <a href="/mastodon-bsky-quillmatiq-orig.png"> -->
<!--   <img class="shadow half-sidebyside" src="/mastodon-bsky-quillmatiq-orig.png"></a> -->
<a href="/mastodon-bsky-quillmatiq-link.png"><img class="shadow" src="/mastodon-bsky-quillmatiq-link.png"></a>

The other useful thing to do with these account links is bidirectional verification. Anyone can _claim_ that they're a given account; you only want to trust them if that account agrees. Platforms can support this by publishing links in both directions, from each account to the other. Clients can then verify by loading both accounts and check each one's account links.

For example, this web site, [`snarfed.org`](https://snarfed.org/), is bridged into the fediverse as ActivityPub actor <code><a href="https://browser.pub/https://fed.brid.gy/snarfed.org">https://fed.brid.gy/snarfed.org</a></code>. Bridgy Fed includes this site's home page in that actor's `alsoKnownAs`:

```json
  "alsoKnownAs": ["https://snarfed.org/"]
```

In return, [this site's home page](https://snarfed.org/) links back to that actor with a `rel="me"` link:

```html
<a rel="me" href="https://fed.brid.gy/snarfed.org"></a>
```

When clients see my fediverse account, they can fetch the `alsoKnownAs` URL, look for the `rel="me"` link, see that it points back to the actor, and confirm that this site and that fediverse account are legitimately the same person. Likewise, if they start from this web site, they can follow the `rel="me"` link and do the same check.

</p>

Mastodon already does this! If you add a profile link to your web site, and then link from your site back to Mastodon with `rel="me"`, [Mastodon shows that link with a green check](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/profile/#verification). Account links in the wild! We love to see it.

Mastodon and Pixelfed users can even set their own account links. The user-facing term for these in the fediverse is _aliases_; here are the [Mastodon docs](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/moving/#aliases) and [Pixelfed GitHub discussion](https://github.com/pixelfed/pixelfed/discussions/4661) for how to set them. Bluesky's [bsky.app](https://bsky.app/) client doesn't have a way for users add aliases to their DID docs yet, but it's straightforward for any Bluesky client developer to add.

There's lots more to talk about here. [You can connect posts across networks with post links](https://fed.brid.gy/docs#identify-bridged-post) just like account links. Multi-protocol clients can use account and post links to automatically show the native versions of every account and post, regardless of where they came from. You could use account links to build an identity aggregator that detects and sets up all of your accounts for you. And so on.

For now, we propose account links as one modest, bottom-up starting point for connecting our myriad identities online. They don't solve all problems. They're not a grand vision. But they do help the open social web say, hey, this person here? They're also that one over there. And they help apps surface those connections to users. We think that's useful.

If you're a developer, and this piques your interest, [check out the Bridgy Fed docs for more details](https://fed.brid.gy/docs#api), and [feel free to reach out to us](mailto:letsbuild@anew.social), we'd love to work with you!
