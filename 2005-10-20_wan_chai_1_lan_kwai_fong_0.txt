I just got back from vacation in Hong Kong. Needless to say, it was awesome. I'd
never been anywhere in Asia before, and I went [with friends who grew up
there](/hong_kong_2005), so I couldn't have had better guides.

The pictures might not be up for a while. I might wait until they're up to post
a longer description...or I might get impatient. Either way, I'll post more at
some point, promise!

_Update_: [pictures are up!](/hong_kong_2005)
