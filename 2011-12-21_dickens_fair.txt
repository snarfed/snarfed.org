Dickens Fair

I had a *great* time at [Dickens Fair](http://dickensfair.com/), the Victorian
England, Christmas themed renaissance faire that's been held every year in San
Francisco since 1970. It's massive, and the production values are amazing. So
many killer details throughout the whole place, so many great performances!

We saw everything from full-on stage plays to impromptu street scenes like
beggars and police, chimney sweeping, and more. It felt like a huge set,
complete with real life characters, that you could walk around inside and touch
and interact with. Not to mention the authentic food, drinks, and old world
craftsmanship like quill pens and pewter goblets and soap made from tallow, all
for sale.

I'm definitely going back next year!
