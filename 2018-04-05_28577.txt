Gina and Brooke were out of town this week, so I've been home alone with the new Zelda, one of the best games I've played in years.

I'm an introvert, so I was sorely tempted to hunker down, hack on work and other projects, and otherwise just play a ton of Zelda.

Instead, I got together with a bunch of friends I don't see often enough. I went for a few long runs. I cooked a bit, edited pictures, read a good book, did some writing. And yes, I played Zelda a lot too.

Sometimes, every now and then, willpower actually works. Sometimes.
