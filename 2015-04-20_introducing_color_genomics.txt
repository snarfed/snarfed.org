[My new gig](/2015-03-15_new_job) has launched!
[Color Genomics](https://www.color.com/) offers $249 genetic screening and
analysis for 19 genes known to impact hereditary breast and ovarian cancer,
including BRCA1 and BRCA2, the genes

This is a big deal. We take the science seriously, and we're working with a
number of leading genetics researchers, including
[Mary-Claire King](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary-Claire_King), who
discovered BRCA1. We're proud of the results we've achieved so far, and we're
looking forward to continuing and expanding this work.

Cancer is one of the greatest health challenges we face today. Despite that,
it's surprisingly hard to get this kind of genetic testing right now, and
nowhere near this price. In an era rich with precision medicine and personal
health tracking, we think scientifically proven, clinically relevant access to
your genetic information should be just as commonplace.
