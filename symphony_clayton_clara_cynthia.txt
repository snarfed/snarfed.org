1645
Symphony with Cynthia, Clara, and Clayton

[Cynthia](http://originalcynk.com/),
[Clara](http://www.insidefacebook.com/2007/10/21/interview-with-clara-shih-co-creator-of-faceforce/),
[Clayton](http://mekong2008.blogspot.com/)
and I had dinner at
[Jardiniere](http://jardiniere.com/), then heard
[Brahms, Copland, and Berg](http://sfsymphony.org/season/Event.aspx?eventid=26928)
at the SF Symphony. Clayton and I did our best, but the girls made us feel
underdressed without breaking a sweat.
