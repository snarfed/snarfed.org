Last weekend,

[Clayton](/w/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/clayton_cynthia_cool.jpg), and
[Derek](/w/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/derek_orkut.jpg)
said goodbye to their Soma loft in style.
[White Party](/white_party) was some of the most fun I've had in a
while.

Everyone really got into the theme. Along with the

there were
[gorgeous decorations](/w/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/boa_chair.jpg),
an

a
[photo booth](/w/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/photo_booth.jpg),
and of course, the world famous Studio 767
[go-go dancers](/w/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/go_go_dancer_2.jpg).

I especially enjoyed putting together
