I started playing piano again recently, after a 20 year hiatus. Our 6 year old Brooke started learning, and we suddenly had a keyboard in the house again, so I joined her. It's been great! I'm playing scales and exercises, diving into Rachmaninoff and Debussy, and working up to tackling Gershwin's _Rhapsody in Blue_. (Not easy.)

Practicing is a grind though. I definitely remember it that way, no rose colored glasses here, but now I appreciate what practice actually does: build muscle memory. Entrench a series of notes and fingerings in my brain with the end goal of playing them automatically, no conscious thought needed. At that point, I can devote my attention to musicality and actually interpreting the piece.

I know a bit more about neuroscience now - that it exists, if nothing else - so the relentless tedium and rote repetition grates on me a bit. It feels like such a crude, anachronistic way to learn anything. What's the state of the art here? Have neuroscientists found any new techniques or deeper understanding of fine motor muscle memory?

One key phrase seems to be _deep practice_, popularized by [Daniel Coyle](http://danielcoyle.com/) in _[The Talent Code](http://danielcoyle.com/the-talent-code/)_ as an expansion of [Anders Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson)'s research on [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice). It's a bit underwhelming, both the underlying science and the practical techniques. The main physiological mechanism that shows up is building [myelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin), the insulating sheaths around axons. That makes sense broadly, but is mylenation really so fine grained and specialized that I grow a _Clair de Lune_ myelin pattern when I practice that piece? Or is it like exercise or eating right, growing evenly and aiding overall cognitive function?

Similarly, the science-inspired practice techniques are believable, but leave me wanting. [Chunking and repetition](https://www.coachup.com/nation/articles/deep-practice-how-the-best-became-the-best) were table stakes when I played piano in high school. Same with [playing slowly](https://www.moltomusic.com/music-practice-tips/slower-is-faster/) and forcefully. The two new ideas I came across were [interval training and distraction](https://www.joytunes.com/blog/learn-to-play/learning-music-the-phenonmenon-of-muscle-memory/), eg turning the TV on (with volume low or off) while you practice.

Nice ideas, and I'll try them, but I guess I was hoping for something more. Hey [Dan Chao](), am I missing anything? Should I pick up a [Halo](https://www.haloneuro.com/)? Where's my ["I know Kung Fu" device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMO3XmNXe4)?

Maybe we're just not there quite yet. Back to the grind, I guess!
