<p>We outdid ourselves with the seasonings on the salmon this year, each from a different person. Top to bottom: orange ginger garlic, Korean BBQ, cedar plank, lemon dill, and the pièces de résistance: crushed Cheetos and Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Both surprisingly good! Cheetos tasted oddly like (good) ground beef, Flamin' Hot was rich and multilayered and not spicy, like a fully sauteed chili pepper.</p>
