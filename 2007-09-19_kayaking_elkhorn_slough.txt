To celebrate [my dad](http://one-one.net/)'s birthday over the weekend, my
family and I went kayaking at [Elkhorn Slough](http://elkhornslough.org/).
[Walter](/w/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/barefoot_ryan_walter.jpg) joined us, too, as
an extended member of the family.

We rented kayaks at [Kayak Connection](http://kayakconnection.com/). They had
good gear, and the people were chill and helpful.

The kayaking was fun, but the wildlife was the real draw. The otters,
shorebirds, seals, and other marine animals were used to people, so they let
us get surprisingly close.

It was particularly cool to see [otters use rocks to crack open crab
shells](http://elkhornslough.org/bestshot/060529bs.htm) and [pelicans dive
bomb to catch fish](http://elkhornslough.org/critters/pelicans.htm). The
seals, on the other hand, just sat around and honked. I guess they didn't feel
like performing for us.

Happy Birthday, Dad!
