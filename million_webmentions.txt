We're celebrating 1 million [webmentions](https://webmention.net/) successfully sent in the wild! We're still narrowing down the exact number, and the exact time we crossed the threshold, but we estimate sometime in December 2017 or January 2018.

Counting isn't easy, since webmention is distributed and peer to peer. There's no single central repository or service that all webmentions go through. There are a number of large tools and services that handle many webmentions, though. We're counting as many of those as we can and adding them up, as a lower bound, and then projecting a bit. Here are the big contributors we've counted so far:

* [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/): [960,778 as of 2018-01-11.](https://brid.gy/#stats) Includes both [silo backfeed](https://brid.gy/about#which) and [hosted blogs](https://brid.gy/about#blogs). [More data and methodology.](https://snarfed.org/2018-01-02_bridgy-stats-update-3)

* [webmention.io](http://webmention.io/): [25,593 as of 2018-01-01](https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-01-01#t1514827271882500), excluding Bridgy. (5570 of those are from [OwnYourSwarm](https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io/).)

* [Telegraph](https://telegraph.p3k.io/): [2400 as of 2018-01-11](https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-01-11#t1515696707684400), excluding webmention.io and Bridgy Publish.
