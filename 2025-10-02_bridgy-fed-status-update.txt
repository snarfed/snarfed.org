Hi everyone! We've been working on a few big projects [since our last status update](https://snarfed.org/2025-08-16_55391), but we've also made progess on smaller improvements and bug fixes for Bounce and Bridgy Fed. Here are the noticeable Bridgy Fed changes since last time.

* [When a bridged user receives a DM, reply and say "DMs aren't bridged"](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/2039)
* [Handle dependent activities that arrive in the wrong order, eg delete before create](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1361)
* [Rate limit activities per user.](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1788) We still bridge everything, we just slow down users individually if they do too much too fast.
* [Accept DIDs as well as handles in DM commands](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1979) (thanks [@tesaguri](https://github.com/tesaguri)!)
