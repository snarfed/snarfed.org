This server was down for approximately 14 hours today, from 7:45 am to 9:45 pm.
The power supply just rolled over and died. I got a new one after work and
installed it as soon as I got home. Apologies all around.

Of course, the power supply only died because I'd removed its fan about a year
ago. (It was too loud.) I don't know if there's some organization like PETA for
preventing cruelty to computer parts...but if there is, man, I'm toast.

In other news, I'm going to see
[Susan](/gallery/Senior_Formal/ryan_suz_good.jpg) next week! We haven't seen
each other since New Years, so I'm excited...

**Updated:** ...excited enough that instead of doing work, I did
[this](/ryan.barrett.name/countdown.html) instead! (And yes, I'm a big fat
nerd.)
