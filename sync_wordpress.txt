[sync_wordpress.sh](sync_wordpress.sh) syncs
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), files, plugins, themes, and options
stored in the database from one WordPress instance to another. The database
options are also checked into a Subversion repository.

It uses rsync to synchronize files, including WordPress itself, themes,
plugins, and config files. It then uses mysqldump to dump non-transient
options in the `wp_options` table, diffs the dump against Subversion
head, and checks it in. Finally, it diffs the dump against the remote database
and applies it.

The user is prompted at each step and may choose whether to copy and update
files, check in the new dump, and apply it remotely. The source and destination
hostnames, directories, and database connection parameters are configurable in
variables at the top of the script.

(There are plenty of other related approaches, e.g. the
[Remote Database Backup plugin](http://www.bin-co.com/blog/2008/10/remote-database-backup-wordpress-plugin/).)

Note: `sync_wordpress.sh` does *not* synchronize posts, pages, comments, or
other content.
