I have a new gig! I'm helping build out the bioinformatics pipeline at
[Color Genomics](http://colorgenomics.com/), a new genomics startup. We sequence
your genes, figure out what they mean for your personal health, and work with
doctors and genetic counselors to help you plan for the future. We're a bit like
[23andMe](https://www.23andme.com/), but more focused on medical research and
clinical application.

[I've been](/2014-01-15_a_new_kingdom) [interested in](/2010-07-31_bio_101)
[biotech](/2010-07-31_bio_1012014-08-25_your-data-our-data) for a while now, and
I've talked with lots of people over the last few years, trying to learn where
the interesting problems are and who's working on them. It's a huge space,
obviously, but when I thought about where I'd like to jump in, I kept coming
back to Color. I'd been a big fan of [Othman](https://twitter.com/othman) and
[Elad](http://eladgil.com/) from back in the day at Google, and I was impressed
with [Taylor](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/author/taylor/) from the moment we
met. The rest of the team is just as high powered. They'll keep me on my toes,
and I can't wait.

I had a great couple years at [Quip](https://quip.com/), and they're definitely
still going strong. I went there for the people, first and foremost, and that
decision paid off in spades. They've put together a killer team, and their work
environment and caliber of talent is second to none. I was just ready to tackle
a new kind of project.

Keep watching this space for news...and wish me luck!
