This server was down for approximately 14 hours today, from 7:45 am to 9:45 pm.
The power supply just rolled over and died. I got a new one after work and
installed it as soon as I got home. Apologies all around.

Of course, the power supply only died because I'd removed its fan about a year
ago. (It was too loud.) I don't know if there's some organization like PETA for
preventing cruelty to computer parts...but if there is, man, I'm toast.

In other news, I'm going to see Susan next week! We haven't seen each other
since New Years, so I'm excited...

**Updated:** ...excited enough that instead of doing work, I did
[this](/ryan.barrett.name/countdown.js) instead! (And yes, I'm a big fat
nerd.)
