I've spent most of my time in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) community on [backfeed](https://indieweb.org/backfeed): sending interactions from social networks and other [silos](https://indieweb.org/silo) back to your web site. The service we built, [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/), has served that need well enough that we haven't seen many other alternatives pop up. [OwnYourGram](https://ownyourgram.com/) for [FourSquare](https://foursquare.com/) is the main one that comes to mind, and if Bridgy had supported FourSquare, I suspect OwnYourGram may have skipped backfeed entirely.

This is a nice vote of confidence, but it makes me sad that we don't have a [plurality](https://indieweb.org/plurality) of backfeed implementations. What's more, it puts us in a bind: backfeed is a substantial engineering project in most cases, so the barrier to entry is high. What's more, Bridgy is heavyweight and comprehensive, which has served it well in many ways, but not when it comes to [adding a new silo](https://bridgy.readthedocs.io/#adding-a-new-silo). [Many people have expressed interest](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new+silo%22) over the years, but [only one has ever actually done it](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/225) - we love you Kyle! - and I don't plan to add many more myself.

We still need more backfeed though! More silos, more designs, more ideas. So here's one: could we do it without any code at all?

Stick with me here. The new generation of internet automation services, led by [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/), are carrying the Yahoo Pipes torch forward. They support hundreds of silos out of the box, and critically, also send and receive webhooks. If you squint, this might be just barely enough to implement backfeed end to end, at least for silos with native [microformats2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2).

Here's a sketch for backfeeding Mastodon replies:

1. Create a new task that's triggered by a new reply to one of your toots.
1. Configure it to send a `POST` webhook to [Telegraph's API](https://telegraph.p3k.io/api) (`https://telegraph.p3k.io/webmention`) with these query parameters:
  1. `token`: your API key
  1. `source`: the reply toot's URL
  1. `target_domain`: your web site's domain
1. ...profit!

Caveats abound. Most silos don't have permalinks for likes and reactions, so they're an open question. Telegraph doesn't have [original post discovery](https://indieweb.org/original-post-discovery) built in (yet), so [backlinks](https://indieweb.org/POSSE#Why_Link_To_Your_Original) are required in the silo posts. Silo-specific quirks like Twitter reply chains and quote tweets are unlikely at best. Finally, most silos don't have native microformats2, so they need to be wrapped in granary URLs in the webmention webhook source parameter.

Regardless, this sounds a hell of a lot easier than Bridgy's [20 steps to add a new silo](https://bridgy.readthedocs.io/#adding-a-new-silo). Hey [2019 Summitters](https://2019.indieweb.org/summit), want to give it a try?
