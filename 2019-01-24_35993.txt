Blockchain is heartbreaking.

As a computer scientist, I love it. It's a fundamental breakthrough: <a href="https://snarfed.org/2016-06-11_decentralized-web-summit#consensus+algorithm">the first open participation distributed consensus algorithm ever</a>. That's a big deal.

As an engineer, I can't responsibly recommend it to anyone for anything. It's slow, unreliable, immature, hard to use, and functionality impoverished. It's a database that hates you.

Truly heartbreaking.
