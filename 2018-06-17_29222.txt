<blockquote>
  Tree, trunk, branch, crown<br />
  Climbing up and sitting down<br />
  Morning sun becomes noon-blue<br />
  All the world is old and new<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Road, street, track, path<br />
  Ship, boat, wooden raft<br />
  Nest, bird, feather, fly<br />
  All the world has got its sky<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  Spreading shadows, setting sun<br />
  Crickets, curtains, day is done<br />
  A fire takes away the chill<br />
  All the world can hold quite still
</blockquote>

Beautiful homespun poem, and my favorite book to read to Brooke, bar none. Happy Fathers Day.
