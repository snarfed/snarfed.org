Micropub for hosted blogs

<a class="h-card" href="http://kevinmarks.com/">Kevin Marks</a> had a
[great idea](http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2015-04-07#t1428449282044) the other
day: a [micropub](https://micropub.net/) bridge service for hosted blog sites
like [Blogger](https://indiewebcamp.com/Blogger),
[WordPress.com](https://indiewebcamp.com/WordPress.com), and
[Tumblr](https://indiewebcamp.com/Tumblr), similar to
[Bridgy's webmention service.](https://www.brid.gy/about#blogs) If you have a
hosted blog, you'd sign into this service, approve it to create/edit/delete your
posts, add its micropub endpoint to your blog's HTML, et voilà! Instant micropub
support.

I don't plan to take the lead on building this, but we do have a clear idea of
what it would take, so I figured I'd throw together some notes like I did with
[indie stats](/indie-stats). Many of the pieces are
[already available](https://github.com/kylewm/flask-micropub)
[as libraries](https://oauth-dropins.appspot.com/)
[and services](http://tokens.indieauth.com/), so hopefully much of the remaining
work is just glue.

Like [Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy/), the front page of the bridge site would
have "sign in" buttons for the hosted blog providers we want to support, e.g.
Blogger, WordPress.com, and Tumblr. Those buttons would start the OAuth dance
and ask for the appropriate scopes to [CRUD](https://indiewebcamp.com/CRUD)
posts.

When the user approves the OAuth prompt, we'd store their silo access token and
show them instructions for adding the bridge's micropub endpoint to their blog's
HTML template.
([Here are example instructions](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/blob/master/templates/tumblr_user.html#L14).)
The endpoint should identify the silo and domain, e.g. `/tumblr/mysite.com`. We
should use [IndieAuth's token service](http://tokens.indieauth.com/) to start,
so we'd include its endpoints too. Here's an example block:

    <link rel="micropub" href="https://micropub-bridge.org/tumblr/mysite.com">
    <link rel="authorization_endpoint" href="https://indieauth.com/auth">
    <link rel="token_endpoint" href="https://tokens.indieauth.com/token">

When a micropub request comes in, we'd extract the silo and domain from the path
(or whatever), look up the access token, convert the request to a corresponding
silo API call, make that call, and convert the response back into a micropub
response.

Here are each silo's API docs for CRUDding posts:
[Blogger](https://developers.google.com/blogger/docs/3.0/reference/index#Posts),
[WordPress.com](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/1.1/post/sites/%24site/posts/new/),
[Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posting).

Who's with me?
