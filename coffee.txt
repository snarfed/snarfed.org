Coffee I've [tried](#tried) and [want to try](#to_try). <good> I liked, <ok> were just ok, <bad> I didn't like. Also see [wine](/wine), [beer](/beer), [chocolate](/chocolate), and [other lists](/lists).

This isn't comprehensive - I've tried others that aren't listed here - and it's biased. If I mark something <nobr><bad></nobr> here, I may still think it's good overall, but just doesn't match my own personal taste, and vice versa.
