WordPress spam statistics: comments, pingbacks, trackbacks

Comment spam is one of the most common forms of WordPress spam, if not the most common.

Here are some anecdotal statistics for this site. During the month of November
2014, [snarfed.org](https://snarfed.org/) received 796,990 POSTs to its comment
form, `wp-comments-post.php`, vs just 2139 POSTs to `xmlrpc.php` (based on
server logs). Of those, 9 comments and 3 trackbacks were ham. I also use XML-RPC
to create and edit posts. So there was at least ~400x more comment from spam
than pingback/trackback spam during that month.
