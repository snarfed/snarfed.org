Bridgy Fed status update

[Last time here, a couple weeks ago](https://snarfed.org/2023-08-04_bridgy-fed-status-update-3), I had an incomplete, bare bones ATProto PDS up and running. I planned to finish it, hook it up to the [federation sandbox](https://atproto.com/blog/federation-developer-sandbox) BGS and AppView, switch to [`did:plc`](https://atproto.com/specs/did-plc) DIDs, and learn and implement the [v2 repo](https://atproto.com/specs/repository#repo-data-structure-v2), [websocket event streams](https://atproto.com/specs/event-stream), and [`subscribeRepos`](https://atproto.com/lexicons/com-atproto-sync#comatprotosyncsubscriberepos).

All that is done! Along with [low-S ECDSA signatures](https://atproto.com/specs/cryptography#ecdsa-signature-malleability) and a number of other things. The end result is a seemingly complete ATProto PDS.

...which leaves interop testing. That's where I am right now. Getting close to having that working!

On the side, I've been implementing [Nostr](https://nostr.com/) in [granary](https://granary.io/). I shipped that last week, so now I'm starting to add it to [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/). That has a good chance of shipping before ATProto/Bluesky federation gets turned on.
