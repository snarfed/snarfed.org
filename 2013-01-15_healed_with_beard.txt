Healed, with beard

When I posted about [my ATV accident](/2012-12-31_atv_accident), I didn't
include much of an epilogue. Was I laid up for weeks? Will my face never be the
same? Or was I back to normal the next day? Enough people asked since they
haven't seen me in person, so I figured I should put any fears to rest.

I'm fine! I've pretty much fully healed. There's some nerve damage that will
take months more to recover, and I welcomed the excuse to stop shaving and grow
a beard, but otherwise I've been back to full health for the last couple weeks.

Just as well, too, since we moved into
[a new house](/2013-01-13_lazy-sunday-on-the-deck-at-the-new-house) right after
the accident, and we've been lugging boxes, working on the yard and other
projects, and generally racking up the manual labor.

Most importantly, I'm fine. No need to worry. Thanks for all your notes and
concern!
