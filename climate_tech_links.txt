Climate tech links

A collection of links and resources for climate tech and the climate crisis, compiled in 2020. Also see _[New job, hello climate tech](/2021-05-31_new-job-hello-climate-tech)_, _[The year is 2040](/2020-05-17_the-year-is-2040)_, and _[Climate tech conversations](/climate-tech-conversations)_.

**Communities:**

* [ClimateAction.tech](https://climateaction.tech/), probably the oldest Bay Area tech community for climate
* [My Climate Journey](https://www.myclimatejourney.co/), best climate tech community I've found so far, tons of heavy hitters. also a podcast and angel fund
* [New Energy Nexus](https://www.newenergynexus.com/network/), energy specific, also has an accelerator and fund(s)
* [Work on Climate](https://workonclimate.org/), nascent but pretty good, started by ex Googlers. They have a ton of other irons in the fire, [ClimateCTO](https://climatecto.com/) and [Climate Fellows](https://climatefellows.org/) and running the climate track at an ML conference, they may be spread a bit thin.
* [Witnesses of Climatology](https://www.facebook.com/groups/701103413374218/) quirky but great people. Ex Googlers Malcolm Blaney and Olya Irzak are here, among others.
* [Terra.do](https://terra.do/), pretty rigorous online class for climate science, policy, tech, etc foundations.
* [Climate Draft](https://www.climatedraft.org/), individually focused incubator for tech industry veterans looking to jump into climate tech. I've participated on a number of its events, [eg this one for engineers](https://myclimatejourney.substack.com/p/common-misconceptions-for-software).

**Media, newsletters, podcasts:**
