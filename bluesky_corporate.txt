Collecting details here from various places on [Bluesky PBLLC](https://blueskyweb.xyz/)'s corporate structure, ownership, governance, and history.

> Today, we are excited to announce the formation of the Bluesky PBLLC, a Public Benefit LLC that will implement that vision as an independent organization....We were formed in late 2021 with the initial funding provided by Twitter. Our board members include Jack Dorsey, a founder of Twitter, Jeremie Miller, the inventor of Jabber/XMPP, and Jay Graber, CEO of the Bluesky company.

> Bluesky was announced in 2019 but the legal entity itself was only recently set up...Bluesky began with an idea, developed into a community, and solidified into a company, in three stages. The formation of Bluesky, PBLLC at the end of 2021 marked the beginning of the most recent stage, where we now have funding and an organization to pursue our mission.

> @jay: [he] can't  
> @csm : Because of board structure? Or org structure?  
> @jay: jack doesn’t have unilateral power. he has 1/3 influence on the board. i’m the CEO

Also, as far as we know from various conversations, Bluesky hasn't yet taken any other funding beyond Twitter's initial $13M grant. It's a substantial amount of money, they've only existed for a couple years, the team is still small, and they probably don't have many costs beyond headcount. They have ideas for revenue down the line, but they say that won't be a focus for a while yet. (From threads on Bluesky that I saw originally but haven't managed to find again yet to cite. Please add links in the comments if you find them!)
