Excited to announce that I'm teaming up with [Anuj Ahooja](https://quillmatiq.com/) on a new non-profit for the open social web, across protocols, with Bridgy Fed as its first main project! [Introducing A New Social.](https://www.anew.social/hello-social-web/)

When I posted _[Possible futures for Bridgy Fed](https://snarfed.org/2024-11-01_53932)_ a while back, I was surprised  and gratified by the outpouring of support. So many of you really believe in it and want it to survive, grow, and find a stable footing beyond the useful little one-person side project it is today.

Some people stepped up even further and said, "I'm willing to put the work in and actually help build, drive, and even lead this." Anuj is one of those people. He's a renaissance man who's worked on the fediverse and open social web for many years at [sub.club](https://sub.club/), [Flipboard](https://flipboard.com/), and more. He's [written at length](https://www.augment.ink/bridges-the-last-network-effect/) about the potential he sees in the open social web, across all sorts of networks - "people, not platforms!" - and how we have an opportunity now that we haven't had in a long time.

And there are so many more of you, across the space, who've joined and committed to supporting us! We're truly humbled and grateful. We're still only at the very beginning, we have a lot of work to do, but we're excited to get started. Wish us luck, and please [reach out if you want to get involved](https://www.anew.social/contact/)!
