A while back, [I wrote up a design for bridging Microsub clients to traditional feed reader backends](/microsub-bridge). Fast forward to a few weeks ago: [I hacked together a bare bones prototype](https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-06-27#t1530141961518300) at [IndieWebCamp 2018](https://2018.indieweb.org/). Fast forward to now: I'm launching [Baffle](https://baffle.tech/)!

Baffle lets you use [Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub-spec) reader apps like [Together](https://indieweb.org/Together), [Indigenous](https://indieweb.org/Indigenous), and [Monocle](https://monocle.p3k.io/) with traditional feed readers like [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com/) and maybe eventually [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) and more.

Right now, it only supports viewing channels and timelines. If there's enough interest and usage, I can add channel management, muting, and blocking. I'd also consider adding Feedly if I hear enough desire.

Happy reading!
