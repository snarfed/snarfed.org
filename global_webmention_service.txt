Global webmention service

There's a recurring project idea in the [indieweb](https://indiewebcamp.com/)
community: a service that sends [webmentions](http://webmention.org/) on behalf
of web sites that don't send them already. We already have
[a handful](https://telegraph.p3k.io/)
[of services](https://brid.gy/about#how)
[that do this](https://brid.gy/about#blogs)
for some verticals, and we've kicked around
[ideas](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/420) for more.

Here's a straw man design for a service that does the opposite: finds web pages
that link to your web site and sends you webmentions for them.

You enter your domain on the front page. When you do, it sets up a
[Superfeedr](http://superfeedr.com/)
[tracking feed](http://documentation.superfeedr.com/trackers.html) that
[watches for links to your site](http://documentation.superfeedr.com/trackers.html#link).
When it finds one, it notifies the service, which sends a webmention from the
source page to each page on your site that it links to.

...that's it! It's so small and simple, I almost hoped I could do it with
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) or [Zapier](http://zapier.com/) or something
similar, but not quite. It would definitely be easy enough on
[App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) or
[Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or any other PaaS.

This is still just another vertical, of course. The real coup would be to get
[Superfeedr](http://superfeedr.com/) to do this for all web sites it tracks,
which is a big swathe of the public web. They're in a unique position, too; they
already do most of the hard work, and they're indieweb friendly to boot!
