Santa Cruz Offsite 2006

We headed back to the [Santa Cruz Beach
Boardwalk](http://www.beachboardwalk.com/) on Thursday for the fourth annual
Google engineering offsite. It was a great excuse to get away and hang out with
co-workers without constantly talking about work, and we had a lot of fun.

OK, we still talked about work...but we also built sand castles and rode roller
coasters and grilled hot dogs and played volleyball and pinball and skee-ball.
Much more fun!

[Pictures from last year](/santa_cruz_offsite) are also up.
