Sea World

Hello and welcome to Sea World...which was really interesting and a nice
exercise in taking pictures of things that move. How'd I do? I got to take the
headshot of the dolphin from 3 feet away! We took a behind the scenes tour and
we got to see them up close...as well a couple of month old dolphin calves. I'll
get those pictures up soon.

The time of "soon" has arrive...and now...the rest of the
[pictures](http://home.maulik.net:8668/images/seaworld/111_1137.JPG.html).
