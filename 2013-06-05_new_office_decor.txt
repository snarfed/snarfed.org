New office decor

Thanks to [Ana](https://plus.google.com/103298930481646016759/posts) and Tamara
Broussard at [Ken Fulk](http://kenfulk.com/portfolio/), we have new office
decorations! The framed items are cool, but the old found objects are easily the
best parts. There's an
[Underwood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwood_Typewriter_Company)
typewriter, an [Ediphone](http://www.recording-history.org/HTML/dicta_tech2.php)
dictaphone, and a [Vibroplex](http://vibroplex.com/original_bug.html) "Original
Bug" ham radio key. Thanks guys!
