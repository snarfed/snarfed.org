Santa Cruz Offsite

For Google's 2005 engineering offsite, we went to the [Santa Cruz Beach
Boardwalk](http://www.beachboardwalk.com/). It was a great excuse to get away
and hang out with co-workers without constantly talking about work, and we had a
lot of fun. OK, we still talked about work...but we also built sand castles and
rode roller coasters and grilled hot dogs and played volleyball and pinball and
skee-ball! Google may be a great place to work, and it does have volleyball and
pinball, but it still doesn't have skee-ball, much less sand castles or roller
coasters. We'll have to work on that.
