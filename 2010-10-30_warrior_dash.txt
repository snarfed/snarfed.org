Imagine a triathlon, a Halloween party, and Army basic training had a drunken
love child. Got that image in your head? Throw in a dash of
[hashing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_House_Harriers) and a few thousand
turkey legs and you've got [Warrior Dash](http://warriordash.com/).
[Maulik](http://maulik.freeshell.net/) and Sarjita did it last year, and they
had enough fun that they inspired me to try it this year out here in the Bay
Area.

[Cynthia](http://originalcynk.com/),
[Josh](http://joshuaredstone.blogspot.com/), and I headed down to Hollister this
morning for the event. We proceeded to cover ourselves in body paint, scream
battle cries, sack refreshment booths and pillage port-a-potties, and generally
work up a good frothy bloodlust in preparation for the run and obstacle course.

The [pictures](/warrior_dash_2010) speak for themselves, but in case
there's any doubt, it was a blast. Check out the
[course map](http://warriordash.com/register2010_norcal.php) for more.
If it looks like your kind of thing, [drop me a line](/about) and come with us
next year!
