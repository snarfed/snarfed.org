<p>I know <a href="https://perfectdailygrind.com/2019/11/how-temperature-can-impact-your-experience-of-coffee/">temperature affects the flavor of coffee</a>, but I still consistently find myself surprised at just how different a single cup can taste - earthy, nutty, chocolatey, bright berry acidic - as it cools from too-hot to just-right to not-quite-hot-enough to barely-warm.</p>
