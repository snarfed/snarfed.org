POPOS tour

[Inspired by Schemer](http://www.schemer.com/scheme/omrj2c4q9bi6e/mjpk2p2tm0bf4),
I dragged my family and Gina on a tour of a few of San Francisco's POPOS earlier
today. From [SPUR](http://www.spur.org/)'s
[San Francisco POPOS survey](http://www.spur.org/publications/library/report/secretsofsanfrancisco_010109):

> “POPOS” stands for privately-owned public open spaces - publicly accessible
> spaces owned and maintained by the owner of an office building. POPOS come in
> many forms: plazas, roof gardens, greenhouses, atriums and others. Some POPOS
> are easily accessible, while others are tucked away and more difficult to
> find.

If you can get past the
[public policy debates](http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/blogs/joe-bonk/15350/when-public-spaces-go-private-sector),
POPOS are an unsung treasure of many big downtown areas. They feature
unconventional architecture, great sculptures, and gardens ranging from delicate
flower arrangements to small forests. Some we pass by every day and never really
notice, others are out of sight just beyond a door or up a flight of stairs.
Office workers may have a favorite for lunch or coffee breaks, but may not
explore others or visit outside of work, and the rest of us might never discover
them at all.

Luckily, organizations like SPUR and
[New York's DCP](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/priv/priv.shtml) have put
together surprisingly good [guides](http://www.spur.org/files/popos-guide.pdf)
and
maps like [this one](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=215305625166679665263.000494a2f8e47681a4953&ll=37.787437,-122.3913&spn=0.020112,0.045447&z=15):

Starting on Mission between 1st and 2nd St., we managed to find a wide variety
in just a single city block. The urban garden at 555/575 Market was lush and
opulent and lush, if a bit inaccessible. 25 Jessie's garden was a hidden gem,
cozy and out of the way and clearly very loved. 525 Market had a fountain and
sun terrace protected by a thick cluster of trees. The plazas at 555 and
[560 Mission](http://www.yelp.com/biz/560-mission-street-plaza-jp-morgans-west-coast-headquarters-san-francisco)
were roomy and substantial, especially 560's deep bamboo grove. Finally, the
[tea garden at 100 1st](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tea-garden-san-francisco) was
the coup de grace, a massive sunny pavilion with plenty of seating, water, and
greenery. It's popular during working hours, for good reason.

Next time you're in downtown SF, take a few extra minutes and check out a nearby
POPOS or two. They're worth it!
