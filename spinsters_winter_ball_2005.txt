Spinsters Winter Ball 2005

Peter and I went to the [SF Spinsters](http://sfspinsters.com/)' chic, black tie
holiday ball at the [Maritime Museum](http://www.maritime.org/). We couldn't do
black tie right if we tried, so I have no idea why they let us in...but we
didn't argue! The party, the people, and the afterparty at [Ana
Mandara](http://www.anamandara.com/) were a blast. I'm counting down the days
until the winter charity ball in February!

More pictures to come...
