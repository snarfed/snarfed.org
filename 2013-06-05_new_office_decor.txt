New office decor

Thanks to [Ana](https://plus.google.com/103298930481646016759/posts) and
Tamara Broussard at [Ken Fulk](http://kenfulk.com/portfolio/), we now have fun
new office decorations! The framed items are cool, but the old found objects are
easily the best parts. There's an
[Underwood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwood_Typewriter_Company)
typewriter, an [Ediphone](http://www.recording-history.org/HTML/dicta_tech2.php)
dictaphone, and a
[Vibroplex](http://vibroplex.com/original_bug.html) "Original Bug" ham radio
key. Thanks guys!
