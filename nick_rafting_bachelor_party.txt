Rafting for Nick's Bachelor Party

Before we could [let Nick get married](http://nickandmaureen.com/), we had to
send him out in style. For his bachelor party, we went
[white water rafting](http://raftwet.com/) on the American river, then camping
not far away. Not only that, but we cooked a foodie-worthy dinner with just our
camping equipment, including a new invention, s'mores flamb√©d with rum.

[Nick's Picasa album](http://picasaweb.google.com/koshnick/BachelorTripSnaps).
Thanks, Maureen!
