For the impatient:  
&nbsp; Download [comments_openid.py 0.4](/comments_openid.py)  
&nbsp; Download [Python OpenID libraries](http://www.openidenabled.com/python-openid/)  
&nbsp; Download
  [comments.py](https://pyblosxom.github.io/registry/comments/comments)
  and [session.py](https://pyblosxom.github.io/registry/general/session)

[comments_openid.py](/comments_openid.py) is a
[PyBlosxom](https://pyblosxom.github.io/) plugin that allows
[OpenID](http://openid.net/)-authenticated comments. When used in conjunction
with the
[comments plugin](https://pyblosxom.github.io/registry/comments/comments),
it allows people to comment on your PyBlosxom-based site
using their OpenID provider. In addition, if their provider supports the
[Simple Registration Extension](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/simple-registration-extension),
it displays their nickname instead of their OpenID URL under the comment.

To use it, first download and install the
[Python OpenID libraries](http://www.openidenabled.com/python-openid/). Then, download
[comments.py](https://pyblosxom.github.io/registry/comments/comments)
and [session.py](https://pyblosxom.github.io/registry/general/session)
plugins and
[enable comments](https://pyblosxom.github.io/Documentation/1.3.1/manual/c888.html) on
your blog.

When you're ready, add a note in your `comments-form` template that the URL
input field now supports OpenId:

    <input name="url" id="comment-url" type="text" value="$cmt_link" />
    <label for="url">Web site or <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a></label>

Then, add this setting to your `config.py`:

    # A directory for the OpenID library to use to store information about
    # OpenID servers and logins. This directory should be outside of your
    # public web space.
     py['openid_store_dir'] = '/path/to/data/directory/'

Change the path to an appropriate directory on your web server, and you should
be good to go!

Apart from `openid_store_dir`, there are several configuration settings that
allow you to control comment access based on OpenID:

    # Trust root for the OpenID Request. Defaults to the base URL of your page.
    # (All URLs should fall under this directory.)
    py['openid_trust_root']  
    
    # If this is set to True, do not allow comments unless OpenID
    # authentication succeeds. Defaults to False.
    py['openid_required']  
    
    # List of patterns for identities and OpenID servers to always reject. The
    # patterns follow the form of OpenID trust roots, which are basically URLs
    # that allow * in the domain name to match any subdomain. For more
    # details, see the entry on openid.trust_root in
    # http://openid.net/specs.bml#mode-checkid_immediate.
    # Both default to empty lists.
    py['openid_reject_identity']  
    py['openid_reject_server']  
    
    # Lists of patterns for identities and servers to allow. If either of
    # these options are set, only OpenID URLs that match are allowed. Both
    # default to empty lists.
    py['openid_allow_identity']  
    py['openid_allow_server']
