I'm slow

Speed is all the rage these days.
[Move fast and break things](http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/2012/02/01/facebooks-hacker-way-move-fast-and-break-things/),
[iterate fast](http://softwaredev.quora.com/When-in-Doubt-Iterate-Faster),
[fail fast](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2013/01/23/want-to-fail-fast-do-these-three-things/)
and
[learn from your mistakes fast](http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2011/11/28/fail-fast-how-startups-can-learn-from-their-mistakes/)
and
[pivot fast](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672580/5-ways-big-companies-can-pivot-like-lean-startups)
so you can do it all over again. We scorn bloated governments and dinosaur
bureacracies and praise [lean startups](http://theleanstartup.com/principles)
and lightweight crowdsourcing. We crow that even the rate of change itself is
speeding up, praising
[internet time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_time) and marvelling that
the smartphones and social networks we take for granted didn't exist five or ten
years ago.

That's all well and good, but it doesn't fit me personally. There's pretty much
nothing I'm naturally quick at besides running and maybe eating. Left to my own
devices, I don't work fast, play fast, think fast, or talk fast. I'm notorious
for circling back hours or days after a meeting with new ideas. I _definitely_
don't context switch fast; hell, I'd rather
[avoid them altogether](/2013-05-31_fighting-information-overload-and-beyond).

I blame some of my sloth, and the proverbial fires under my friends' asses, on
the genetic lottery and personal preference. People have a wide range of natural
speeds. As with most things, you can speed yourself up or slow yourself down
with practice, but it's always relative to your baseline. I wouldn't even
recommend diverging from that too much. It might be useful temporarily, but
people who push too fast for too long end up burning out. They definitely
[sacrifice quality along the way](http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons).
Likewise, if you slow yourself down too much, or you're constantly blocked from
making progress, you'll eventually lose interest and motivation.

So why, do we worship at the altar of speed? Why does fast and broken seem
better than slow and working? First, instant gratification is powerful. No one
likes to wait, and nowadays we often don't have to. Technology has streamlined,
democratized, and accelerated almost everything. Our business environment and
stock markets are designed to reward growth, progress, first- and second-mover
advantage, and momentum of all sorts.

Those of us who design and build products (and services, creative works, etc.)
now largely agree that iteration is the key to success. If you want to end up
with something good, your best bet is to take a quick first stab, get it in
front of people, make them use it and give you real feedback, incorporate that
feedback, and repeat. Many of us are so convinced of this that we think
succeeding _without_ iterating is the exception, not the rule.

I'm a believer. Success probably does depend more on the
[number of iterations](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/cash-is-not-king.html)
than anything else. The corollary is that if you want to build something good
faster, and you can't cut down the number of iterations, you cut down the
time you spend on each iteration instead. That lands us squarely in circular
logic land - to move faster, you have to move faster - but at least it helps
explain some of the speed fetish.

<a id="enough-iterations"></a>
Even so, the accepted wisdom for startups isn't _enough iterations,_ it's _move
faster_. Granted, "enough iterations!" isn't exactly a killer war cry, but it
has the benefit of actually being right. If you keep your speed sustainable, and
you take iteration seriously and incorporate real feedback from real users,
you'll probably beat the people running themselves ragged without a compass.

On another note, if you're doing anything creative,
[research](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/science/18angier.html)
[has](http://www.crackingthelearningcode.com/element31.html)
[concluded](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/325/5940/621.abstract) that stress
is your kryptonite. When you're under stress of any kind, your brain cuts off
precious oxygen from the higher level regions responsible for creativity,
learning, and lateral thinking, and doubles down on fight or flight responses in
your amygdala. This is why long hours of crunch mode
[usually result in _lower_ productivity](http://www.igda.org/why-crunch-modes-doesnt-work-six-lessons)
over the long term, not higher. The conclusion is clear: if you need to be
creative, don't stress yourself out by moving faster than your baseline.

On the other hand, if you naturally run fast, the world may be too slow for you.
If you love the adrenaline rush of a tight deadline, or you come alive when
you're firefighting an emergency, the right kind of stress might just be good
for you. The key is to know your baseline and be true to it, even when
you're expected not to.

My hopes here are modest. I'm not trying to overturn our speed fetish, or to
scold people who enjoy moving fast. As with [most of my posts](/category/essay), this
is primarily introspection. I know my baseline is slow, and I'm exploring the
implications by writing about it. I
[may work at a fast-moving startup](/2013-07-30_introducing-quip) right now,
but who knows. When I look for my next job, maybe I'll slow down to a stately,
leisurely stroll. Academia, anyone? Or I could just retire and play golf. I'll
keep you posted.
