It's been a month since the last [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) status update, so it's time for a new one! I've spent a lot of time over the last month on user-visible improvements and bug fixes, notably more complex post types and links, as well as underlying infrastructure. Details below.

One area I need to spend more time on is cost. My attempts at optimization there have been slower than I'd originally hoped. I intentionally prioritized functionality over cost efficiency for a long time, and I'm still optimistic that I can get cost per user down to a reasonable level. If I do that, but user count itself gets too high...that will be a wonderful problem, and I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. üòÅ

(Standard disclaimer: Bridgy Fed is non-commercial, free, [open source](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed), and ad-free, and I have no plans to change any of that or ask for donations any time soon! It's one way I try to support and give back to the open social web.)

Beyond cost, I'm hoping to work on [native replies](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1047) and opt in prompts via DM, [both](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/966) [directions](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1148), soon.

As usual, feel free to ping me with feedback, questions, and [bug reports](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues). You can follow the [_now_ label on GitHub](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Anow) to see what I'm currently focusing on. See you on the bridge!
