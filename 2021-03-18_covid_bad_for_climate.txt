The standard narrative on how the pandemic affected the climate goes something like this: _People worked from home, cancelled travel plans, and cut down overall consumption. As a result, emissions fell drastically. It's great for the environment! Let's keep it up!_

[With apologies to H. L. Mencken](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/07/17/solution/), I believe that narrative is neat, plausible, and wrong.

To be fair, it's absolutely right about the pandemic's obvious, direct effect on greenhouse gas emissions. [Worldwide CO2 emissions decreased by ~7% in 2020](https://www.carbonbrief.org/global-carbon-project-coronavirus-causes-record-fall-in-fossil-fuel-emissions-in-2020) ([paper](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/3269/2020/)) relative to 2019 levels. In percentage terms, that's the largest recorded drop since WWII.

The reduction was driven primarily by reduced transportation and energy generation driven by the economic downturn and pandemic-related behavior and consumption changes. Many people stopped commuting, stopped traveling, and consumed less in a variety of ways.

However, this decrease is ["just a tiny blip on the long term graph."](https://grist.org/climate/the-pandemics-effect-on-emissions-was-just-a-tiny-blip/) To keep global warming under 2°C, we'd need sustained emissions reductions in this range every year for the next 20-30 years. The pandemic has been hugely disruptive over the last year, but it's still largely temporary, and all signs point to a relatively strong recovery. The drop in emissions was caused primarily by temporary behavior changes, not persistent structural changes.

To cut emissions permanently, we need massive infrastructure changes across more or less all of society. Perhaps most of all, they'll take money. Lots of money. In the US alone, [switching to renewable and zero-carbon energy could cost close to $10T. Electrifying transportation, heat, and industry could cost another $7.5T.](https://www.saulgriffith.com/blog/gnd-how-much-does-fixing-climate-change-cost) These are investments, not expenditures; over the long term, they'll pay for themselves many times over, and result in invaluable co-benefits as well. We'll still need to pay for them up front, though, and therein lies the rub.

After human lives and health, the second biggest victims of the pandemic has been the global economy. In short, [it's the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession). [Instead of growing 2.5% in 2020 as expected, the global economy shrank by 4.3%. Add in a similar shortfall in 2021, and the lost growth alone totals $10.3T worldwide.](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/01/09/what-is-the-economic-cost-of-covid-19) The numbers are far bigger if you're comprehensive and long term and include the costs of health care and lost income and output: [over $16T in the US alone.](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/11/what-might-covid-cost-the-u-s-experts-eye-16-trillion/)

It's hard to isolate COVID-specific economic aid, but [estimates so far put total global economic stimulus at ~$15T](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/many-rich-countries-lag-in-efforts-to-steer-covid-19-stimulus-to-green-projects-62617859), or [~17% of global GDP](https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/imf-and-covid19/Fiscal-Policies-Database-in-Response-to-COVID-19). Due in no small part to this aggressive action, [the OECD currently projects global GDP to grow by 5.6% in 2021](https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/the-need-for-speed-faster-vaccine-rollout-critical-to-stronger-recovery.htm), a striking recovery after [shrinking 4.2% in 2020](https://www.oecd.org/economic-outlook/december-2020/).

One silver lining of all this stimulus will be the continued ready availability of cheap capital. For years now, we've been printing and lending money like it was water, and so far we've managed to avoid the cost of higher inflation. This has helped drive a [worldwide boom in climate tech investing and startups](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/sustainability/publications/state-of-climate-tech-2020.html), even beyond the growth in venture investing overall. It should also make those trillions in infrastructure spending a bit easier to swallow. Good news for the climate on both counts.

What's more, [some of that aid aims at infrastructure and other projects that directly impact climate](https://www.vivideconomics.com/casestudy/greenness-for-stimulus-index/). Sadly, the net effect may be negative: $4.6T is going to emissions-intensive sectors like agriculture, transportation, and industry, while only $1.8T is earmarked for "green" initiatives like clean energy.

What's more, COVID meant residential solar installers couldn't go door to door or enter homes to install. New renewable energy installations and efficiency projects slowed, and outbreaks at wind turbine and solar panel plants shut them down for extended periods.

(One radical proposal is to slow down or reverse economic growth itself, aka ["degrowth"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth). As a climate strategy, this is misguided, since emissions are driven by total economic activity, not growth. Even if the global economy _shrank_, it would still emit far too much greenhouse gas, and billions of people's livelihoods would suffer in the process. Fortunately, economic growth and emissions aren't necessarily linked: the developed world has [_reduced_ its emissions significantly over the last couple decades](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region) while growing its GDP, largely due to efficiencies and cleaner energy. [Andrew McAfee's _More From Less_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/More_from_Less/TLiuDwAAQBAJ) is a great deep dive on this.)

OK, so the direct emissions impact was small, and the economic impact is big. How else did COVID affect the climate? Will there be any lasting effects?

At a high level, we don't know yet. We're starting to see light at the end of the tunnel, but we're nowhere near done with the pandemic yet, much less far enough past it to know the long term impacts. We can still speculate though!

To start, we've now hopefully renewed our interest in epidemiology, public health, and health care preparedness. This is inconsistent, though, and it doesn't have clear direct impact on the climate crisis. More biotech research may provide an indirect boost to [bio-engineering for carbon sequestration](https://www.livingcarbon.com/), but that's difficult to predict or quantify.

We've also seen a massive shift toward work from home and virtual travel. Again, it's too early to know how much of this will last. If anything, [early signs in the US show _more_ trips outside the home than a year ago](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/travel-coronavirus-leave-home/2021/03/10/03aefaf0-81a3-11eb-ac37-4383f7709abe_story.html), before lockdown began. Even so, many more people are now willing and able to work, socialize, and even go on vacation from home than a year ago. That will take time to fully unpack, but if it sticks, it's a clear win for transporation emissions.

Another persistent COVID narrative has been urban flight, especially among professionals and families. Suddenly working from home and afraid of other people, city dwellers packed up and moved to the country in droves. While the data [doesn't show a meaningful increase in total moves](https://www.hireahelper.com/moving-statistics/covid-migration-report/#section-5), it [does show a net migration out of urban areas](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/cfed-district-data-briefs/cfddb-20210205-did-the-covid-19-pandemic-cause-an-urban-exodus.aspx).

Taken at face value, this is net negative for the climate. Land use is responsible for ~10% of GHG emissions. A big wave of migrants settling and developing it would drive that up even higher. [As Edward Glaeser writes](https://www.city-journal.org/html/green-cities-brown-suburbs-13143.html):

> ...a point that is both paradoxical and generally true: if you want to be good to the environment, stay away from it. Move to high-rise apartments surrounded by plenty of concrete. Americans who settle in leafy, low-density suburbs will leave a significantly deeper carbon footprint, it turns out, than Americans who live cheek by jowl in urban towers.

Fortunately, I doubt this trend will stick. [The clear story over the last couple centuries has been a steady migration _into_ cities](https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization), both globally [and in the US](https://www.nber.org/papers/w24084), [for all sorts of good reasons](https://ourworldindata.org/urbanization#urban-populations-tend-to-have-higher-living-standards). COVID may dampen this trend for a bit, but I don't see it reversing entirely.

The most important conclusion here may not economic aid, or working from home, or anything else, but hope. One of the most common surprises I've heard from people about the pandemic was how it made them question things they'd take for granted for years, or even decades. They saw possibilities they hadn't known existed. [As I wrote last year](/2020-05-17_the-year-is-2040#And+yet):

> The world shook itself off, stumbled to its feet, and haltingly pulled itself back to work. Economies grew again, one by one, people felt safer, bit by bit, and they remembered what they’d seen. The Himalayas towering over India. Blue skies over Shenzhen. Streets full of people instead of cars. The night sky ablaze with stars. People remembered, and they demanded change.

[It's time to build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/), and it's [time to build for the climate](https://medium.com/energy-impact-partners/what-to-build-climate-edition-950f079a2a3f). More importantly, though, we may now have a bit more conviction that we _can_ still build. We lost a year to the pandemic, in many ways, but that's not so much in the grand scheme of things.
