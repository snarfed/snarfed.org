<a href="https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/about-xfinity-wifi-internet">Xfinity WiFi Hotspots</a> is a great product. I can walk into pretty much any coffee shop or bar or park, open my laptop, and I'm immediately online. No begging baristas for a password, no sketchy FREE PUBLIC INTRNET 4 REALZ access points, no fiddly tethering to my phone. So nice.

(Yes, <a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> the company. I know. Feel free to complain about them in the comments, I may or may not join you.)
