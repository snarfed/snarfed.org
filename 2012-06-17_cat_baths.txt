Cat baths

We gave our cats a bath today. It's not exactly an original topic on the
internet - hell, [Cats in Sinks](http://catsinsinks.com/) was our original
example site for [App Engine](https://appengine.google.com/) - but it's still
fun.

We didn't come up with a crazy twist, or use a cat-washing robot, or take HDR
photography, or even
[add lolcat captions](http://builder.cheezburger.com/Builder), but the pictures
do have some good "aww poor kitty!" moments. Enjoy!
