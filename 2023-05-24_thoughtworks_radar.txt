I don't spend much time on software engineering industry reports, but the [Thoughtworks Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) is one I love. Broad, clear-eyed, hands on, eminently useful. Bite-sized analyses of ~100 tools and techniques, new and old, with recommendations to adopt or trial or assess or hold, and a brief nod toward overarching themes. It's evidently become so successful that it's [spawned an entire category](https://www.workingsoftware.dev/inspirational-technology-radar-examples/).

The [latest volume](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/archive#download-current-radar) came out last month, and as usual, it's a banger. I'm only maybe a third of the way through, and I already have todos to learn more about [run cost prediction](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/run-cost-as-architecture-fitness-function), [accessibility testing](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/intelligent-guided-accessibility-tests), and [Logseq](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/logseq-as-team-knowledge-base), among others.

Free, ~40 pages, twice a year. Not an ad, I have no affiliation with them, just a fan.
