Great quote from [Zhenghua](https://twitter.com/zhenghuali) at work today:



> Three things I've learned about [Color engineering](https://www.color.com/careers): for whatever topic I raise, [Ryan](/) has a blog post, [Huy](https://twitter.com/huy) has a cartoon, and [Youssef](https://twitter.com/youssefmss) is against it.



So true!
