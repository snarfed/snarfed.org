We're celebrating 1 million [webmentions](https://webmention.net/) successfully sent in the wild! We're still narrowing down the exact number and when we crossed the threshold, but we estimate sometime in December 2017 or January 2018. [Join us for the party](https://indieweb.org/Webm1m), [Wed 1/24 at your local Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/events/2018-01-24-homebrew-website-club)!

Counting isn't easy, since webmentions are distributed and peer to peer. There's no single central repository that all webmentions go through. There are a number of large services that handle many webmentions, though. We're counting as many of those as we can and adding them up, as a lower bound, and then projecting a bit.

As of 2018-01-11, a conservative projected estimate is **1,011,447**. The absolute lower bound is **989,847**.

Here's everything we're counting:

* **[Bridgy](https://brid.gy/): 960,778** [as of 2018-01-11.](https://brid.gy/#stats) Includes both [silo backfeed](https://brid.gy/about#which) and [hosted blogs](https://brid.gy/about#blogs). [More data and methodology.](https://snarfed.org/2018-01-02_bridgy-stats-update-3)

* **[webmention.io](http://webmention.io/): 25,593** [as of 2018-01-01](https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-01-01#t1514827271882500), excluding Bridgy. 5570 of those are from [OwnYourSwarm](https://ownyourswarm.p3k.io/).

* **[Telegraph](https://telegraph.p3k.io/): 2400** [as of 2018-01-11](https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-01-11#t1515696707684400), excluding webmention.io and Bridgy Publish.

* **[mention-tech](https://mention-tech.appspot.com/): 176** [as of 2018-01-11](http://known.kevinmarks.com/2018/i-just-checked-mention-techappspotcom-and-it-has-sent-176-webmentions).

* **Hosted [Known](https://withknown.com/): Unknown; estimate 5-10k.** We've asked Ben, he says he'll run the query soon.

* **[webmention.herokuapp.com](https://webmention.herokuapp.com/): Unknown; estimate 5-10k.** We've asked voxpelli, but no answer yet.

* **[micro.blog](https://micro.blog/): Unknown; estimate 5-10k.** [Colin Walker alone has received 900](https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-01-11#t1515694600966100). [We've asked Manton, but his logs aren't great.](https://chat.indieweb.org/2018-01-11#t1515694425797400)
* **Long tail: Unknown; estimate 5-50k.** This includes all purely site-to-site webmentions that didn't go through any of the services above. I have no real data to inform this projection, which is why the range is so big.
