<p>I like exercising first thing in the morning. I feel good for the rest of the day, and I'm less likely to skip it.</p>



<p>I also like working first thing in the morning. It's quiet, there are fewer distractions, and my head is clear of the detritus that inevitably builds up over the course of the day.</p>



<p>On any given day, I can only do one, not both. And I like routine, so I don't really switch back and forth. So for decades now, I've exercised in the morning on weekdays and worked in the morning on weekends.</p>



<p>I guess I could get up at 4am every day, exercise, and then work, but I'm nowhere near that aggressive. (To be clear, I don't deserve "credit" for any of this anyway. I only do it because it feels good and it works, not out of some Puritanical, holier-than-thou work ethic.)</p>



<p>Still, it would be nice to find a routine that somehow included both of these!</p>
