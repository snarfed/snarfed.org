I wish I had a better sense of where gravity comes from. Anyone have good intuition that they could explain?

I obviously get *what* it is: apple falls from the tree, etc. And I think I more or less get *how* it is: Newtonian mechanics, general relativity, curved spacetime, etc.

But I do not get *why* it is. Why does gravity exist? Why do large accumulations of mass naturally pull other mass toward them? üßê

One theory I've heard is that there's a universal field, like the Higgs, with particles traveling in all directions and colliding with mass. If you're near a massive body like a star or planet or moon, it blocks some particles on its side from hitting you, but not from the other side, so the net effect pushes you toward it.

That would make gravity related to volume instead of mass, though, which obviously isn't right. Still, I don't remember hearing any other explanations. Does anyone know of any?
