I've just posted an
[OpenID server plugin for PyBlosxom](/space/pyblosxom_openid_server).
[OpenID](http://openid.net/) is a distributed authentication
protocol, ie a single sign on platform, that uses URLs as identifiers.
With this plugin on your [PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.sf.net/) site, you can
login anywhere that accepts OpenID.

Identity and authentication have been classically thorny, unsolved problems
for the real-world Internet. They're easy to solve in closed, centralized
organizations, like schools and companies, but difficult in a global,
decentralized network. What's worse, the difficulties aren't just technical,
they're political and social.

OpenID is exciting for a number of reasons. It's decentralized - _federated_,
more accurately - and it solves the hard problems by cheating. OpenID uses DNS
and URLs, succesful technologies that have stood the test of time, for its
namespace, routing, and auth delegation. This means they skip most of the
hard problems altogether, and they can leverage lots of existing code for free.
Even more importantly, the average user already understands and trust URLs.

To be brutally honest, the rest is mostly glue. Sure, non-trivial crypto glue
on the technical side, and adoption hurdles on the social side...but still
just glue.

Most of the time, when you come up against a problem, chances are good that
people smarter than you have already solved it. Taking advantage of their
smarts, and hard work, is always a winning strategy.

So, if it wasn't obvious by now, I'm a fan. I'm psyched to do more stuff with
OpenID.
