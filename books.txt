I felt the exact same way about this [that I did about his last book](#You%20Are%20Not%20a%20Gadget): "Thoughtfully contrarian, in a good way. I didn't find all of his arguments compelling, but I'm very, very glad that someone's making them!"

<bad>
<unfinished>  
Much heralded. I wanted to like it, and I did like the first section, but the
second section, a long transcribed interview with a billionaire tech founder,
just didn't work. Maybe it's because I live in that world, but the language and
tone felt totally, gratingly wrong. Sad.

Meh. Forgettable. None of the character or settings really grabbed me, nor did

[Jennifer Senior - _All Joy and No Fun: The Paradox of Modern Parenthood_](https://books.google.com/books?id=d3J3lwEACAAJ)
<good>
<nf>nf</nf>  
A must read if you're a parent, or even just curious. Way more useful than all the popular how-to, what-to-expect, and reference books. The last chapter is mixed, but the rest more than makes up for it.

[Pierre Bayard - _How to Talk About Books You Haven't Read_](https://books.google.com/books?id=mouUBOg6FckC)
<bad>
<nf>nf</nf>  
Maybe I should have taken the author's advice and written this without reading
the book. :P I couldn't tell how much was serious and how much was a joke. Not a
great sign. My sense of humor may not be refined enough, but of his main points,
only one made sense to me:

1. Reading/not reading a book isn't binary but a spectrum. You can hear about a book, read parts of it, read it and then forget some of it, or even forget you read it at all. (OK.)
1. We all interpret books differently, and our interpretations are more important and valuable than the books themselves. (Um...not so much.)
1. It's usually better not to read any given book than to read it, since it's mostly unnecessary and it imposes an opportunity cost. (Um...not so much.)
1. Finally, the ultimate aim of thinking and talking about books (and other works of art) is to be creative, in particular <em>about ourselves</em>. (Creative, sure, but about ourselves? Narcissism, no thanks.)<br />
&nbsp;

[Daniel C. Dennett - _Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking_](https://books.google.com/books?id=iPkK8JxzYUQC)
<ok>
<nf>nf</nf>  
Meh. I love Dennett's work in general, but this just didn't hang together well enough for me. The bulk of it isn't intuition pumps at all, but loosely connected essays on topics like computation, evolution, and free will, lightly interspersed with the titular thought experiments.  
Dennett himself describes it best: "Some readers...expressed surprise and disappointment that [this book] didn't include some of my best-known intuition pumps." Yup.

[Meg Wolitzer - _The Interestings_](https://books.google.com/books?id=CUtVMQEACAAJ)
<ok>

Not much of a plot, but great characters and relationship arcs.

[Niccolò Machiavelli - _The Prince_](https://books.google.com/books?id=AHh3d4Xk9IAC)
<ok>
<nf>nf</nf>  
Not nearly as crazy or controversial as its reputation suggests. I was expecting over-the-top malicious, underhanded, downright sadistic stories and techniques, but it was actually pretty tame, even logical and common sense.  
Sadly, that also made it less exciting. Lots of politics, campaigning, managing employees and projects, governance and public policy, etc. Important topics, to be sure, but we've learned a bit more about them since Machiavelli's day.

[Jon Gertner - _The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation_](https://books.google.com/books?id=5i0nLwEACAAJ)
<ok>
<nf>nf</nf>  
The list of Bell Labs's inventions is simply stunning: the transistor, switched networking, microwave and satellite communication, digital information theory, fiber optics, cellular radio and telephony, Unix and C, the CCD. Add in a few things from Fairchild and Xerox PARC, like the IC, and you have pretty much all modern computer and telecom technology. This is worth reading as a reminder of that alone.

<ok>
<nf>nf</nf>  
Lots of great content! The format isn't ideal, though. The essays are only a couple pages each or so, so you bounce between ideas a bit too fast. Still good in small doses though.

I gave up about a third of the way in. It's slow, uninteresting, joyless, and devoid of any characters I can relate to at all.  I'm sure it works for some people, but not for me.

[Steven Pinker - _The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature_](https://books.google.com/books?id=7rJ5gI1LbXoC)
<good>
<nf>nf</nf>  
The first half or so, parts 1 through 3, are great. Read them alone and you have a five star book. Parts 4 and 5 got too unfocused, though, at least for me.

[David Foster Wallace - _The Pale King_](https://books.google.com/books?id=bFmguAAACAAJ)
<bad>
<f>f</f>  
Finished, this could have been a great book. Unfinished, it's just too disjointed, even for DFW. It may not be experimental fiction, exactly, but it's not far off. It's basically a series of loosely related vignettes, some short, some longer, with a handful of recurring characters. It's still enjoyable, and occasionally rises to the brilliance I'd hoped for, but as a whole it's nowhere near the level of Infinite Jest or Broom of the System. Ah well!

Thoughtfully contrarian, in a good way. I didn't find all of his arguments compelling, but I'm very, very glad that someone's making them!

<!-- notes:
good classification
generally agree w constrained vision
esp systems instead of people, tradeoffs instead of solutions, institutions as a whole, over time, instead of individual end results of those institutions
also similar to agile, incremental design vs waterfall
not sure about anti-social science, modern psych research and behavioral economics does good work in understanding, eg recency bias, confirmation bias, loss aversion
also not sure about focus on smaller groups, which promotes us vs them, but like
idea that we ratchet up to bigger and bigger groups
