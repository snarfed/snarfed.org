  Based on [Linnaea Mallette](https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/browse-author.php?a=18382)'s _[Vintage Map Ship Octopus Ocean](https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/en/view-image.php?image=490157&picture=vintage-map-ship-octopus-ocean)_
</a></p>

If [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) was a mythical sea monster, and the protocols - webmention, ActivityPub, Bluesky, etc. - were its limbs, then the [protocol-independent activity router](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/529) might be its...brain?

Or...its heart? Or something? In any case, that router is finally done, at least for now. Progress!

I plan to deploy it to [production](https://fed.brid.gy/) today. It's a big change, so I expect at least a full day or two of bug triage and fixes, if not more.

After that, big context switch to [ATProto](https://atproto.com/), jumping back into [arroba](https://github.com/snarfed/arroba/) to see what's left, if anything, to get it to [federate with Bluesky's sandbox](https://github.com/snarfed/arroba/issues/3). I expect that to be at least the next week or two, minimum. End result should be a minimal standalone arroba-based [PDS](https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos) that federates successfully.

Onward!
