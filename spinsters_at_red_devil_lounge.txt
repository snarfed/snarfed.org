Spinsters at Red Devil Lounge

The [SF Spinsters](http://sfspinsters.com/) held their [2006 winter charity
event](http://sfspinsters.com/calendar.php) at the [Red Devil
Lounge](http://www.reddevillounge.com/mainpage.htm). I went in spite of the
theme - '80s, argh - but the band was great, and lots of the guests went all out
with their costumes. Peter, Caroline, and her roommates took these pictures
before they left.
