Lately I've been thinking about orphaned code. Code that's still running, live, with no remaining developers or users.

Forgotten hardware devices. Deserted VMs on cloud free tiers. Smart contracts whose DAOs disbanded years ago. Old school internet worms. Abandoned, starving Tamagotchi.

Can you think of other examples?

There are obvious conclusions here about maintainability, ecosystem security, etc, but I'm not here to lecture, I have no particular conclusions. Just a vibe.
