<p>I drink coffee throughout the morning, including before and after brushing my teeth, which makes the coffee taste flat and sweet and nutty, not horrible but definitely not right. I always hated that.</p>



<p>It occurred to me recently that I could just brush without toothpaste. It works! Coffee tastes pretty much normal afterward, and supposedly something like 90% of cleaning comes from the brushing, not the toothpaste.</p>



<p>Odd life hack, but I'll take it.</p>
