My team at work has a few people in New York, and we're adding more fast, so I
went out there last week to work with them in person. My last visit to New York
was 12 years ago, and I spent most of that upstate, so I was looking forward to
exploring Manhattan and Brooklyn with enough time to appreciate them.

The trip did not disappoint. Talking with my teammates there in person was
really productive. I can't overstate the value of low latency, high bandwidth
communication. Even delays as small as a tenth of a second interrupt the flow of
conversation when you're talking on the phone or VC - much less IM or email -
and it's easy to forget how valuable the subtle cues of body language and facial
expressions are. You bond quickly in person and develop relationships that are
tough to match otherwise.

Beyond work, we also hung out with great people and did a ton of fun stuff.
Here's a short summary;
[pictures at the bottom](/2012-05-03_new_york_trip#pictures).

_Monday:_ flew into JFK, checked into
[The Strand](http://www.thestrandnyc.com/), relaxed on their great
[rooftop deck](http://www.topofthestrand.com/). Evidently that's a thing in NY.
Initial impressions: good airport, good hotel, bad wine, bad coffee, dressy
people, diverse demographics (at least, more than SF), and lots of greenery.
Evidently that last part is recent in the last 10 years or so, thanks to
Bloomberg. It made a big impression on me.

_Tuesday:_ More bad coffee at ['wichcraft](http://wichcraftnyc.com/). Learned
the [subway](http://www.mta.info/), which is great. Settled into the Google NY
office, which is nice, if a bit fragmented. Long design meetings at work. Lunch
at [Little Owl](http://www.thelittleowlnyc.com/) (great burger!) with
[Edward](https://plus.google.com/u/0/116391770037151199654). Saw
[Book of Mormon](http://www.bookofmormonbroadway.com/) on Broadway, loved it.

_Wednesday:_ Meh coffee at Starbucks. More long design meetings at work. Dinner
at [wd~50](http://wd-50.com/). We skipped the 12 course tasting menu, but we
shouldn't have. A la carte was still fun, but not nearly as interesting.
Afterward, bad jazz at [Arthur's](http://www.arthurstavernnyc.com/) and
[really freaking good jazz](https://plus.google.com/103651231634018158746/posts/7ZgpLTdfXNN)
at [55 Bar](http://55bar.com/).

_Thursday:_ Ran through Central Park. So big! Gave up on coffee altogether.
Lunch at Facebook's NY office with
[Josh](https://www.facebook.com/joshua.redstone), who's spinning up one of their
first engineering teams there. Dinner in Brooklyn (yay!) at
[Vinegar Hill House](http://www.vinegarhillhouse.com/) with
[Jeremy](https://plus.google.com/102619942144242639061) and
[Sarah](https://plus.google.com/106097161383990499644). Walked back over the
Brooklyn Bridge, had a blast.

_Friday:_ First good coffee! at [Culture Espresso](http://cultureespresso.com/).
Space shuttle flyby at the Google office. (and again...and again...) Dinner at
[Perilla](http://www.perillanyc.com/) with
[Jane](https://www.facebook.com/janelu) and
[Derek](https://www.facebook.com/derekc).

_Saturday:_ Brunch uptown with [Sam](http://www.facebook.com/samzg) and
[Judith](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=585697848) (and Ariella!).
Supervised our wedding registry at Macy's. Sightseeing at Rockefeller Center,
Radio City Music Hall,
[High Line](https://plus.google.com/103651231634018158746/posts/NW3999vcWkA),
and Chelsea Market. Tried to get tickets to
[Sleep No More](http://sleepnomorenyc.com/), failed, settled for dinner at
[Bell, Book and Candle](http://bbandcnyc.com/).
