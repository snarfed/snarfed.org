A search engine for the whole [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) has been a [hot conversation topic](https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2018/11/25/scoping-out-basics-of-indieweb-search), on and off, for many years now. Many of us have [search](https://indieweb.org/search) on our own individual sites, and more ambitious projects like [cweiske](https://cweiske.de/)'s [phinde](https://cweiske.de/tagebuch/phinde.htm) can [search IRC archives](http://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/), but building a full fledged search engine to crawl and index _all_ IndieWeb sites has always been a bit too big a project to bite off. (Not to mention the question of [which sites we should include](https://indiemap.org/docs.html#sites) in the first place.)

As usual, my first instinct is always [software prevention](https://snarfed.org/2017-01-23_23351). Whatever the task at hand is, someone has else has pretty much always tried to do it before. Often they've even succeeded, to some degree. Search is certainly no exception. Google has offered custom search engines for individual sites for a long time, so I threw together one that searches all of the IndieWeb sites in [Indie Map](https://indiemap.org/), plus lots more that have joined the IndieWeb since then. It seems to work pretty well. [Try it out](https://cse.google.com/cse?cx=001473925626342383772:izm-5gxypp4) and let me know what you think!
