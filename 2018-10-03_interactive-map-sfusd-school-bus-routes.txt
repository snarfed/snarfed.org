_TL;DR: [click here for the map!](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1aeI2sgAY-iL8dwf4_SvmY3NckTb_5LT4)_

We have a [school age kid](http://brookebarrett.org/), so we've been ramping up on the [San Francisco school admissions process](http://www.sfusd.edu/en/enroll-in-sfusd-schools/how-student-assignment-works/the-assignment-process.html), aka lottery. It's, um...complicated.

We've been to a couple informational sessions so far. At one of them, a representative from [PPS-SF](https://www.ppssf.org/) mentioned that there are no central databases for yellow school bus routes or school tour dates. My antennae immediately went up.

Fast forward a few weeks, and I found a bit of time to poke around. The school bus routes are all [published as PDFs](https://www.sfusd.edu/en/transportation/school-bus-schedules.html), so after a [quick script to parse and clean them up](https://github.com/snarfed/misc/blob/master/sfusd_buses.py), I was able to import all 44 schools, 143 routes, 153 locations, and 579 stops into [Google MyMaps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/).

Sadly, it doesn't include a visible path for each individual bus route. MyMaps limits maps to 10 layers, and every driving path has to be in its own layer. Still, [the map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1aeI2sgAY-iL8dwf4_SvmY3NckTb_5LT4) is searchable by school, location, route, stop, and time, so it should be pretty navigable.
