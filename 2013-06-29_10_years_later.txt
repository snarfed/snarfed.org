It was [10 years ago today](/2003/page/5) that I started this web site with the
post, ["I'm a big fat foofyblog."](/2003-06-29_blogtastic) Not exactly an
auspicious beginning, but it's turned into an online home that has stood the
test of time. To celebrate, I gave it the gift of
[a redesign](/2013-06-16_redesigned) and partied with its host,
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), which
[also turned 10](http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/ten-good-years/) just last
month. Happy anniversary, [snarfed.org](/)!

At the beginning, I planned to use it to
["post pictures, video, news posts, and just general updates"](/2003-07-07_blogg_vorbis),
and that's stayed pretty much true. As I
[described a year ago](/2012-07-25_why_i_have_my_own_web_site):

My focus here has wandered from [side projects](/software) to
[pictures](/pictures) to activities to [essays](/tags/essay) to microblogging
and back again, but that's ok. I've put it through
[plenty of changes under the covers](/about) too:

Come to think of it, there isn't a single thing about this site that's the same
as when it started...except the domain. It still lives at [snarfed.org](/), just
like it did a decade ago, and God and
[#indieweb](http://markmhendrickson.com/homesteading-on-the-indie-web) willing,
it'll still be there in another decade or two.

Happy anniversary, [snarfed](/)! And thanks to all of you for reading!
