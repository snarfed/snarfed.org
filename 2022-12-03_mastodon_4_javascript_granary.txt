So [Mastodon 4](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/releases/tag/v4.0.0) went [js;dr](https://indieweb.org/js;dr), which means it requires JavaScript to render content. That means that server-side fetches of Mastodon 4 user profiles and posts, eg [indieweb.social/@snarfed](https://indieweb.social/@snarfed), no longer return the actual contents in the response. They definitely no longer [include microformats](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/122). üòê

JavaScript and [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)s are their own conversation, but regardless, this is a step backward for the open web and server-to-server communications like the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) uses. Fortunately, there's a workaround: use [granary](https://granary.io/)! Plug any Mastodon 4 profile or post URL into [granary's ActivityStreams 2 converter](https://granary.io/?input=activitystreams#logins) and you'll get the full contents in HTML, Atom, RSS, or any other format you want. Works via REST API and [pip-installable Python package](https://pypi.org/project/granary/). [Here's an example.](https://granary.io/url?input=as2&output=mf2-json&url=https://indieweb.social/@snarfed) You can even get a user's feed from their ActivityPub outbox URL, eg for `@alice@mas.to`, plug `https://mas.to/users/alice/outbox%3Fpage%3Dtrue` into granary.

Happy hacking!
