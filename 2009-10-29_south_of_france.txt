We spent most of our recent
[vacation](2009-10-27_back_from_vacation)
in [Paris](2009-10-28_paris) and
[Barcelona](2009-10-28_barcelona), but we reserved the last four days for
the south of France, specifically
[Nîmes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nîmes) and
[Sommières](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sommières), a little town
where Jeremy's family is from.

[Pictures](south_of_france_2009) are up; read on for impressions.

Jeremy's mother invited a group of us to stay with her in Sommières: Jeremy,
me, Jeremy's brother [Neils](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=723232881)
and his wife, Elaine, and two of their friends from
[Insead](http://www.insead.fr/), where Neils is going to school. After the big
city life, constant travel, and full time sightseeing of Paris and Barcelona, it
was great to slow down and stay in one place for a while without much of an itinerary.

We took a train, the [TGV](http://www.tgv.com/EN/index_HD.html), from Paris to
Nîmes. High speed trains may not be new, but it was the first time I'd taken
one. So simple, so easy, so little overhead!

Nîmes was built and heavily influenced by the Romans. They built most of its
enduring landmarks, including the imposing
[Maison Carrée](http://www.arenes-nimes.com/en/nimes/68-the_square_house_/),
the aging [Tour Magne](http://www.arenes-nimes.com/en/nimes/69-the_magne_tower/),
and the traditional Roman style
[Arenes](http://www.arenes-nimes.com/en/nimes/41-an_exceptional_amphitheatre/),
where gladiators once fought. It still hosts bull fights, concerts, and
other events even now, which is remarkable.

The Roman influence is visible throughout the city. Garden landscapes, streets
named after Roman emperors, statues in public squares, and common family names
all betray that heritage.

Sommières is a small town about 30 minutes outside of Nîmes. Walking around
Sommières was a trip. The narrow, winding cobblestone streets, the stone
buildings built into steep hillsides, and the thousand year old foot bridges
all made me feel like I was back in medieval Europe.

Evidently it's packed in the high season, roughly June to September, but it
was very quiet in late October.

Jeremy's mother and her family grew up in Sommières, and they still own a
traditional, U-shaped residence with a few different flats, a front gate that
opens into a courtyard, and a sprawling garden and back yard. It felt very,
very old world, which I enjoyed.

The area reminded me a lot of Napa and Marin here in northern California.
Great weather, friendly people, slower lifestyle, lots of farmland and
vineyards and bicycles. Evidently the French use it the same way too, as a
fun, warm, relaxing getaway from city life.

Of course, we had to go wine tasting.
Neils and Elaine had visited
[Château La Clotte-Fontane](http://www.charlesnealselections.com/wine/languedoc-rousillon/la-clotte-fontane/)
recently, just outside Sommières, so we decided to go there. The owners,
Maryline and Philippe, welcomed us and invited us back to their house for a
tasting. The view was incredible. The conversation was mostly in French, since
everyone else was fluent, but I still managed to catch bits and pieces.
Sitting on their terrace, eating good sausage, and drinking great wine was
one of the most memorable moments of the trip.

The next morning, Jeremy and I went for a trail run. We started on a bike
path, but soon veered off onto a trail that passed old style French farm
houses, camp sites, streams, vineyards, and other back woods scenery. It
doesn't sound like much, but I really enjoy running through interesting places -
[like I wished in the Versailles gardens](2009-10-28_paris#versailles) -
so this easily ranked as another memorable moment. We later took a group bike
ride around the same area, complete with mini tandem for Jeremy's nephew.

Later that day, we went to the Sunday market. It was similar to farmers markets
here, less produce but more amazing cheeses, meats, herbs, and even a
[surprisingly good microbrew](http://brasseriedesgarrigues.fr/).

There were plenty of other highlights, including family of Jeremy's who live
in Sommières, traditional French meals, an impromptu concert, and exploring
the rest of the town and countryside. All in all, it was a great way to end
the trip.

Still to come are posts about food and drinks, museums and art, and overall
impressions...
