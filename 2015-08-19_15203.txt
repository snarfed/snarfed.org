My [silly](/2011-08-03_why_im_weird_about_privacy) [privacy](/2012-09-22_revisiting_why_im_weird_about_privacy) [antics](/privacy_through_prepaid_credit_cards) landed me in a [VICE article on privacy and prepaid credit cards](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-simple-trick-ashley-madisons-users-could-have-used-to-protect-themselves).

Mildly embarrassing; definitely entertaining. Thanks to [John Ambrosio](http://motherboard.vice.com/author/JohnAmbrosio) for the reporting!

One of my favorite quotes:

> When asked about the possibility that people might be providing false information to remain anonymous, a representative from Simon said "we would never discuss this level of detail in public."

Can't wait to hear all the dirt when I talk to them in private!
