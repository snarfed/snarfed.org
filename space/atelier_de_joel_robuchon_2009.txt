L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon

While we were on [vacation](2009-10-27_back_from_vacation) in
[Paris](2009-10-28_paris), we managed to get a seat at
[L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon](http://www.restaurants-joel-robuchon.com/modele.php?resto=2&ville=Paris&rub=presentation&image=1&langue=eng)
It was the best meal we had on the trip, bar none.

The pictures are from
[Jane's album](http://picasaweb.google.com/JaneLu05/ParisOct2009).
