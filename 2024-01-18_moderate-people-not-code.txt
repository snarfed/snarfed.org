The scope of the fediverse has been [hotly debated recently](https://fediversereport.com/last-week-in-fediverse-ep-51/). [Are we a big fedi? Or a small fedi](https://evanp.me/2023/12/26/big-fedi-small-fedi/)? [Are instances just nodes? Or networked communities?](https://merveilles.town/@lrhodes/110555014534253768) Which [Camp of Mastodon](https://heat-shield.space/mastodon_two_camps.html) are we in? [How far should our replies travel](https://xoxo.zone/@fraying/111734924727494794)? [How about](https://genart.social/@twilliability/111688775264827884) [our blog posts](https://mastodon.social/@fromjason/111737319152217700) and [Bluesky skeets](https://mastodon.online/@mastodonmigration/110511687993851111)? Should we [welcome](https://reb00ted.org/tech/20231208-meta-threads-data-dialogue/) [Threads](http://plasticbag.org/archives/2024/01/how-threads-will-integrate-with-the-fediverse/)? Or [block](https://fedipact.veganism.social/) [them](https://fedipact.online/)?

Should we open the fediverse to everyone, let them exercise freedom of association, embrace the inevitable [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September), and [get good](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand#Sourced) at managing the problems? Or should we learn that Twitter's "global town square" was net negative, and instead prevent those kinds of harms from the beginning, only expanding online communities [once we have their consent](https://privacy.thenexus.today/free-fediverses-and-consent/)?

_Should there be one internet? Or multiple, sometimes separate internets?_

I have a vested interest in this topic. I [build and run two bridges](/2023-11-27_re-introducing-bridgy-fed), [Bridgy](https://brid.gy/) and [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/), that push the boundaries of the fediverse by integrating traditional web sites and blogs. These bridges are small so far, but [as I add Bluesky and other networks](/2023-11-15_bridgy-fed-status-update-9), I expect them to grow and attract more attention and stress test those boundaries. I have decisions to make regarding how these bridges work, and this question squarely impacts those decisions.

If there's a right answer, I don't know it yet. I have thoughts, naturally, but I know other people have much more knowledge and experience here. There may not be a settled answer yet, but still, [I have more to learn here](/2023-04-15_im-not-eating-my-own-dog-food). Not to mention that as a straight white guy, I have plenty of privilege to check, and not much lived experience of being harassed or mistreated online. This is one way for me to think out loud, work through ideas, ask questions, and hope for useful feedback. Thanks in advance.

Here's one possible conclusion: _Moderate people, not code._ When you choose who to federate with or block or mute, don't look at protocols, or networks, or software. Look at users, and communities, and their behavior. At the end of the day, when you decide who to interact with online and why, those are what you really care about.


## Context collapse, or where is the fediverse anyway?

Let's take a step back and look at the [WordPress ActivityPub plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/). Historically, it was easy to tell a WordPress blog and a fediverse server apart. The blog is an island. It has posts, and comments, but they stay on the blog. They're not federated.

The fediverse server, on the other hand, _is_ federated. It has local users, but it also shows remote users and posts from other servers. When they interact, those interactions flow across all of the servers involved. This is the fediverse we know and love.

When you install the ActivityPub plugin on your WordPress blog, it is suddenly now _also_ a fediverse server. It federates posts, replies, and other interactions back and forth with other "native" fediverse servers, like we'd expect. If a post is federated to the blog's followers, and someone in the fediverse replies, that reply federates back and appears as a comment on the post.

Is this surprising? Is it a [problematic instance](https://xoxo.zone/@fraying/111734924727494794) of [context collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse)? Maybe! But why? The exact same thing happens between "true," native fediverse servers.  In both cases, the post and reply are public, and can be seen by anyone on the internet. The [publics](https://indieweb.org/publics) may different somewhat, but in both cases, the reply is federated to a _different place_ than it was originally written. There isn't an obvious way to differentiate "native" from "non-native" fediverse servers.

This all applies to other social networks too, whether bridged or native. When [Mostr](https://mostr.pub/) bridges a fediverse post into [Nostr](https://nostr.com/), it copied the post to Nostr relays just like federation copies it to fediverse servers. Same with Threads, or Flipboard. Same with Tumblr, if/when they add ActivityPub support.

Is this a cultural problem? Blogs are a generation older than the fediverse, and they each grew up with different norms and user expectations. Web sites may _feel_ different than "native" fediverse servers. Those expectations and feelings may not match the technical reality of ActivityPub, but they still matter.

This kind of context collapse even happens entirely _within_ the fediverse. People on Mastodon and Pleroma tend to interact with each other more than with people on link aggregators like [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/) and [kbin](https://kbin.pub/), or video sites like [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en), or streamers on [Owncast](https://owncast.online/). Those communities each have relatively distinct cultures. However, they still all happily [federate posts](https://lemmy.world/post/10417324) [and replies](https://www.reddit.com/r/PeerTube/comments/ypgbk8/comment/ivkpsar/) back and forth. Does everyone understand and expect that? Is it meaningfully different from federating with a blog?


## Qui consentit

Context collapse is just one problem. Many early fediverse people were [queer and trans refugees from mainstream social networks](https://wedistribute.org/2023/06/a-partial-queer-trans-and-non-binary-history-of-mastodon-and-the-fediverse/) who'd been mistreated there and wanted someplace smaller, safer, and more welcoming. Much of the early fediverse staked out a clear position of rejecting intolerance, a la the [paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance).

For them and others who see the fediverse as a safe haven, "small fedi" is more than just a preference. It's a key part of feeling safe online. Far right instances like Gab and Truth Social may technically support ActivityPub - some are even [based on Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social) - but the fediverse anticipated that they'd harass these marginalized people, and blocked them to prevent that.

Giants like Meta, Automattic, [and Flipboard](https://flipboard.medium.com/flipboard-begins-to-federate-c56ec788feaa) may not pose quite as much clear and present danger, but they still have huge, more mainstream populations that are new to the fediverse and might still pose risks. Even the "native" fediverse itself has long included bad actors and instances that routinely get defederated.

Federating or defederating at the instance level is generally opt-out. Most instances default to allowing federation with any other instance. When an admin block another instance, they add them to a blocklist and opt their entire server out of federating. However, some instances flip this and federate on an opt-in basis. Unknown instances start out blocked, and admins have to manually add them to an allowlist before they're allowed to federate.

[Jon Pincus calls this _consent-based federation_](https://privacy.thenexus.today/free-fediverses-and-consent/), and I like it a lot. It's bold, and not how I personally connect with people online, or how I think all instances should work, but I deeply appreciate the _consistency_ that it provides admins who are strongly protective of their users. If you believe in small fedi, if you don't trust Threads or #TwitterMigration or Eternal September, you should be able to exercise your freedom of association and choose who to federate with _based on who they are and what they do_.

This means focusing on people and communities more than networks or software. And not a moment too soon! So far, big commercial social networks haven't federated for business and product reasons, but those are changing. Web sites and blogs historically couldn't speak ActivityPub; [but now](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/) [they do](https://meta.discourse.org/t/activitypub-plugin/266794). [Other](https://blueskyweb.xyz/) [decentralized](https://nostr.com/) [networks](https://www.farcaster.xyz/) use their own protocols, not ActivityPub, but [bridges are closing those gaps](https://mostr.pub/). And the fediverse has always had plenty of homegrown abuse and bad actors, using Mastodon and other "native" fediverse servers.

To be fair, networks and protocols sometimes have their own cultures too. The fediverse grew on the backs of progressives, queer people, and others who the mainstream often saw as misfits. Bluesky famously found early traction with shitposters and [TPOT](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rtM3jFaoQn3eoAiPh/explaining-the-twitter-postrat-scene). Nostr is full of Bitcoiners. Old graybeards like me still cling onto the blogosphere, idolizing [Yahoo Pipes](https://retool.com/pipes) and writing thinkpieces alongside our big tech day jobs.

These are obviously overgeneralizations. They only have a kernel of truth, at most, and as these networks grow, that kernel shrinks. And that's the point! Whether [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) or [ATProto](https://atproto.com/) or [webmention](https://webmention.net/), the underlying technical protocol a community uses to interact online is a poor way to judge who they are and whether your own community might like them. Same with how their web sites and apps look, or whether they post toots or links or videos, or what they call replies and comments and responses.

The best way to judge a community is to _actually judge_ them. Look at who they are, what they say, and how they behave. If you have your own community or instance, you'll have your own bar for who you want to interact with. Fitness groups may not federate with comfort food cooking clubs. Jewish synagogues probably won't federate with Nazi havens. That's great! Make those judgments for your communities, instance by instance, not by network or server software. Those sledgehammers are too big.


## Users, instances, and mod services

Of course, even instance-level, consent-based federation is still a big sledgehammer. Much of the time, an instance itself isn't rotten, it may just have a bad actor or two, or someone who made a mistake. User-level tools like blocks and mutes often seem like a better first step in these cases.

However, throwing people to the wolves on their own, naked, seems like the wrong idea. Most people who experience abuse online don't have the time or knowledge or willingness to wade through it and block themselves up to a sustainable level. Nor should they have to. [Pincus describes this well](https://privacy.thenexus.today/free-fediverses-and-consent/):

> Even if you're not an expert on online privacy and safety, which sounds better to you: "Nazis and terfs can't communicate with me unless I give my permission" or "Nazis and terms can harass me and see my followers-only posts until I realize it's happening and say no"?

Quite so. This isn't a nail in the coffin of user-oriented moderation features, but it's a clear indictment when people have to use them _in isolation_, separately, everyone for themselves. Same with admins; they shouldn't have to constantly be on the back foot playing catch-up with every new troll farm and CSAM warren.

Fortunately, collaborative moderation tooling has made solid progress recently, much of it grass roots and bottom up. Email server admins were pioneers here with shared graylists of domains and IPS like [Spamhaus](https://www.spamhaus.org/) and [DNSBL](https://www.dnsbl.info/). The social space had shared blocklists early too, followed by independent tools like [Block Party](https://www.blockpartyapp.com/) for Twitter. Fediverse-native services like [Fediseer](https://fediseer.com/), [The Bad Space](https://tweaking.thebad.space/), and [FediMod](https://www.fedimod.org/) now help admins share block lists and other information about instances they might or might not want to federate with. Even the ActivityPub protocol itself explicitly supports [federated `Block` and `Flag` activities](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-block) and may eventually add `Report`s.

Other networks have even more ambitious ideas. Bluesky [has a platform](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/01-16-2024-moderation-2023) for [independent moderation and labeling services](https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation). These services might specialize in different areas, eg detecting CSAM or fighting antisemitism. Jewish Bluesky users could subscribe to an antisemitism mod service to proactively filter out abuse so they never have to see it at all.

The IndieWeb's nascent [Vouch](https://indieweb.org/Vouch) protocol brings a web-of-trust approach to moderating webmentions. When you send someone new a webmention, you can include a link to a friend-of-a-friend who knows you both, based on existing links between your web sites. The receiver can evaluate these links and determine whether that person "vouches" for you, and if so, they can accept the webmention and maybe trust you to send more in the future.

Even Nostr, the land of crypto libertarianism and [adversarial interop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pGZ2epF8ZY), has a thriving ecosystem of widely-adopted [shared mutelists](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md#standard-lists) and [moderated groups](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/72.md). Nostr tends to be an anything-goes kind of place, which maybe spurs ideas and innovation here since users need it just to survive? Or maybe not, who knows.

I love all this shared tooling for the same reasons I like consent-based federation and communities over networks: it brings the moderation focus back to people, groups, and their behavior, instead protocols or server software. Some of us want to connect with people far and wide, others want to lock ourselves down and proceed with caution. When we decide how to open up, people and communities feel like the right units to work with.


## Opt-in vs opt-out

For people like me who run bridges, the concrete question we face is whether to make them opt-in or opt-out. Does everyone need to explicitly sign up for a bridge and enable it for each of their accounts? Or should the bridge work for everyone by default, include clear labels, and let people turn it off for their accounts if they want?

Opt-in is the conservative answer, and what some vocal parts of the fediverse [seem to](https://searchtodon.social/Adventures-in-Mastoland.html) [expect](https://www.anildash.com/2023/01/16/a-fediverse-search/), at least for services that provide any kind of global indexing or search. (Bridgy and Bridgy Fed don't, but still.)

However, for services like bridges that live and die by network effects, opt-out seems to be the only way to be broadly useful. If Alice opts into bridging her Bluesky account to the fediverse, people there will see her and her posts, but she won't see their replies or other interactions. More importantly, people in the fediverse still won't see anyone _else_ on Bluesky.

All else equal, people tend to stick with defaults. Opt-in rates are famously low, regardless of what they're for. This is the premise of an entire [pop-sci book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_(book)), [movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory), and famously even a [department of the UK government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioural_Insights_Team). As an example, Mastodon made a big splash and press push for its [launch of opt-in full text search last September](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2023/09/mastodon-4.2/). After four months, one instance looked at the ~800k fediverse users in its database and [found that only 4% had opted in](https://vmst.io/@iostat/111562800612134464).

Certainly, of the remaining 96%, some knew about the option, carefully evaluated it, and deliberately decided not to opt in. But realistically, most of them probably hadn't heard about it, or didn't know how to opt in, or forgot, or didn't feel strongly enough to bother.

<!-- My primary motivation for building bridges is to [scratch my own itch](https://indieweb.org/scratch_your_own_itch). I want to follow people on all of these networks, and interact with them, and I'd rather not juggle a separate account on each network to do it. It takes more work to build out the bridges so that anyone can use them, and definitely costs more to host, but I'm happy to do that work and bear those costs. I see it as a way to give back to the community. -->

If bridges were opt-in, and I could only follow 4% of people on other networks, they would be drastically less useful. I know I'd be much less likely to keep building and running them. What I'm personally interested in building isn't really a justification for anything, of course, but the _utility_ that these bridges provide may be. I hear regularly from a wide range of people that they love Bridgy and Bridgy Fed, that they connect them to other people across the internet in ways that they couldn't otherwise, and that they find real, deep value in those connections. That wouldn't happen, for the most part, if they were opt-in only.


## So...?

Like I mentioned earlier, I have more questions than answers. I'm keenly interested to hear from people who study online communities and their health, all the way back to [The Well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_WELL) and [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) and [Habitat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_(video_game)). I've been following the debates with a close eye, trying hard to understand what it all means and what I should do with Bridgy and Bridgy Fed.

First off, I'd kill for a big, thorough, comprehensive [threat model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_model) of human interaction online. Threat modeling is an important, mature technique from the security community, but I don't see it applied to human behavior very often. Could we bring together the infosec people, sociologists, community managers to come up with a concrete threat model for developers like me to follow? That would be a huge help.

Otherwise, I'm ready to listen. If you've read this far, you can probably tell that I personally lean toward big fedi, inclusion, opt-out federation, and opt-out bridging between networks. Even so, I know open federation doesn't fit all communities. Constent-based, opt-in federation is a great option, _especially_ when it's based on communities, not networks or protocols. _Moderate people, not code._

At the end of the day, though, I'm just an engineer. I'm writing this because I need to type some Python code into Emacs, but I'm not wise enough to know which code to type. Thank you for reading, and thanks in advance for your feedback.
