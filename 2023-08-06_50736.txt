<p>I'm no music critic, but I think <a href="http://imogenheap.com/">Imogen Heap</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk"><em>Hide and Seek</em></a> may be one of the best popular music songs of all time. Right up there with <em>American Pie</em>, <em>Hallelujah</em>, <em>Thriller</em>, etc. Definitely the vocorder's pièce de résistance, I don't know if anyone else has taken that instrument quite so seriously before, or since.</p>
