Movember, you win

Partly in solidarity with [Movember](http://us.movember.com/), and partly because I'm on sabbatical, I've been lazy and haven't shaved for a few weeks. Sadly, I don't have the genes or temperament for serious facial hair, so it all came off this morning.

Still, it was fun while it lasted, and it brought back fond memories of [May Moustache Madness](/mustache_competition) over six years ago. Maybe next year I'll have a tougher constitution!
