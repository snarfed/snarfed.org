We found plenty of fun, unusual, and just plain good food on our
[vacation](/2009-10-27_back_from_vacation) in
[Paris](/2009-10-28_paris), [Barcelona](/2009-10-28_barcelona), and
the [south of France](/2009-10-29_south_of_france). It ranged from street
crepes to Michelin restaurants to little neighborhood bistros hidden along side
streets.

Here are some of the highlights. Also see the pictures from
[Alain Ducasse](/alain_ducasse_2009) and
[L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon](/atelier_de_joel_robuchon_2009).


### Barcelona:

* [Serrano ham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamón_serrano), served with
  grilled bread and tomato tapenade. A standard appetizer in Barcelona.

* A couple traditional Catalan dishes at
  [Les Quinze Nits](http://www.lesquinzenits.com/):
  [escalivada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalivada), kind of a solid, formed
  ratatouille, served here with ham, and
  [rice with cuttlefish and ink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arròs_negre). The
  latter was so rich and savory, so thoroughly seasoned, my nose and taste buds
  were absolutely saturated. Very much my thing.

* Spicy hot chocolate at [Escrib&agrave;](http://www.escriba.es/base_en.html).
  This was common in Barcelona. It was similar to the spicy, chili
  pepper based "Mayan" hot chocolates that are popular here, but less sweet and
  much smaller and denser. If our hot chocolate is drip coffee, Barcelona's is
  espresso. Escrib&agrave;'s was by far the best I had.

* The one serious restaurant we went to in Barcelona was
  [Abac](http://www.abacbarcelona.com/site.php?idioma=eng). Chef
  Xavier Pellicer's unusually creative dishes are representative of the
  Barcelona cuisine that's become well known in foodie circles.

    <img class="left third shadow" src="/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/kitchen_2.jpg" /></a>

  My favorite course was crab served on a base of avocado and tuna and topped
  with a small scoop of basil sorbet. The combination of basil, sorbet, and crab
  was perfect.

* On a related note, I was shocked at how easy it was to get reservations at
  serious restaurants in both Barcelona and Paris. I was lazy and didn't plan
  ahead, but to my surprise, I was able to get reservations only a few days in
  advance for places I expected to be booked solid for weeks. Vive le financial
  crisis!

* [Wine](/wine) from the
  [Penedès](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_Penedès) region, particularly
  [Parés Baltà](http://www.paresbalta.com/default.asp?id=gb&res=1280)'s
  [Marta de Baltà](http://www.paresbalta.com/default2.asp?m=2&pag=productes&t=1&num=150)
  Rioja, which we had at Abac. The region was new to me;
  I'll have to keep an eye out for it in the future.

* [Cava](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_wine#Cava), Catalan sparkling
  wine. Subtly different from champagne, very good and lots of fun.


### Paris:

  <a href="/alain_ducasse_2009">
    <img class="right third shadow" src="/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/07_bresse_chicken_foie_gras_sauce_truffles.jpg" /></a>

* [Apéritifs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apéritif) are de rigueur at the
  beginning of traditional French dinners. Champagne is common, but others
  include [kir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kir_%28cocktail%29), light
  liqueurs, or even sparkling water.
  The [kir royale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kir_%28cocktail%29#Variations) I
  had was interesting, if not quite my thing.

* [Digestifs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestif) occasionally too, usually
  either dessert wines or heavier liqueurs like cognac. We generally had coffee
  instead.

* Croissants and pain au chocolate, of course, at lots of different
  [patisseries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pâtisserie).
  [Tarte tatin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarte_tatin) too. So simple, so good!

* [Street crepes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crêpes#Cr.C3.AAperies), naturally.
  These are scientifically proven to taste best late at night. We had most of
  ours in Plaza St Michelle.

  <a href="/alain_ducasse_2009">
    <img class="left third shadow" src="/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/01_bread.jpg" /></a>

  Crispiness, thickness, quality of batter, and filling are the subject of
  religious debates, all the more when you're not sober.
  [Jeremy](http://www.facebook.com/cotter) stuck with nutella banana, the
  thinner the better. I preferred slightly thicker, with either nutella
  or sugar and butter. [Jane](http://www.facebook.com/janelu) was flexible,
  but usually opted for nutella.

* [Cassoulet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassoulet), my favorite traditional
  French dish, and a very good
  [choucroute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choucroute_garnie) at a little
  neighborhood bistro on a side street somewhere in the 6th
  [arrondisement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_arrondissements). I wish I
  remember what it was called!

* [Andouillette](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andouillette), a coarse, spicy
  French tripe sausage. According to the locals we were with, the andouillette I
  had wasn't particularly good, but I still enjoyed it.

  <a href="/alain_ducasse_2009">
    <img class="right third shadow" src="/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/12_macaroons.jpg" /></a>

* [Chocolate overload at Salon du Chocolat.](/2009-10-28_paris#salon_du_chocolat)
  I discovered lots of boutique French makers, as well as a few from other
  regions, all new to me. More to the point, I got to try lots of their
  chocolate. I'll add them to the [chocolate page](/chocolate) as I work
  through the bars I brought back.

* Surprisingly, I didn't enjoy much of the espresso I had in either Paris or
  Barcelona. It tended to taste flat, sour, and/or slightly burnt to me. Having
  said that, I didn't seek out good coffee like I did with food,
  [wine](/2009-10-29_south_of_france#clotte-fontane),
  [beer](/2009-10-29_south_of_france#market), and
  [chocolate](/2009-10-28_paris#salon_du_chocolat), so I shouldn't
  complain too much. I may just have been drinking lots of Illy.

* [Pierre Gagnaire](http://pierre-gagnaire.com/) was the first serious Paris
  restaurant we went to. Like Pellicer at Abac, Gagnaire is known for innovative,
  progressive dishes, and our dinner there managed to exceed even
  our high expectations.

  <a href="/south_of_france_2009">
    <img class="left third shadow" src="/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/market_herbs.jpg" /></a>

  Highlights included a perfect
  [Café de Paris sauce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Café_de_Paris_sauce)
  (seasoned anchovy butter), a foie gras "creme" (syrup) with black olive
  "jelly" (more like a thick puree) and new carrots, and an oolong green tea
  brewed for us at the door as we were leaving. An unusual digestif, but a
  surprisingly touching gesture.

* A pate and foie gras plate at
  [L'Alcazar](http://www.alcazar.fr/Home/index.php?langage=uk). The service
  there was uneven, and occasionally mystifying, but the food, the important
  part, was consistently good.

* [Alain Ducasse](http://www.plaza-athenee-paris.com/alain-ducasse-plaza-athenee)
  was the next serious restaurant. The service was impeccable, and
  the food was consistently good and unexpectedly creative, despite a
  couple missteps. Highlights include the
  [langoustines](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/04_langoustines.jpg), the
  [spider crab with vodka emulsion](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/05_spider_crab_vodka_foam.jpg)
  (but _not_ the
  [paired salad](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/05_spider_crab_salad.jpg)), a
  [lobster course](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/06_lobster_coconut_curry.jpg)
  with interesting garnishes, and a phenomenal
  [comté jiroa gruyere cheese](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/08_cheese.jpg).

  <a href="/alain_ducasse_2009">
    <img class="right third shadow" src="/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/11_baba_au_rhum.jpg" /></a>

  The [baba au rhum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum_baba) I had for dessert
  nearly stole the show. It came with an entire rum cart -
  I went with a Jamaican dark - and homemade whipped cream. I joked that they
  could give Jane the dessert and I'd settle for just the whipped cream, and our
  server winked at me and left the entire serving bowl. That clinched it.

  As an aside, we thought we recognized the music playing in the background,
  but only in bits and pieces, so we weren't sure. At one point, we thought we
  heard - of all things - the theme from Jurassic Park. Later, it reminded us
  of Star Wars. We finally asked a server, who replied proudly, "Why yes, it's
  Harry Potter! You know, from the movie? It's very fun, no?" Fun, yes, and
  more than a little surreal. We later confirmed the other movie themes too.
  Who knew Hollywood blockbusters made such good dinner music?

* We didn't spend enough time searching for good boulangeries, but we
  still managed to find a few, mostly thanks to
  [Nelson](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/?q=bread+paris) and
  [Kevin](http://facebook.com/kevgibbs). My favorite was the
  6 cereales from
  [Boulangerie St. Louis](http://www.somebits.com/weblog/paris2007/bread.html).

* We ate at
  [L'Ilot Vache](http://restaurant-ilotvache.com/index.php?l=en&e=1&mod=0&inco=presentation)
  one night on a whim, for no better reason than it was still seating at 9:45
  when we walked by, and we loved it. The cow decor was cute and cozy,
  and the food was traditional and consistently good.

  <a href="/atelier_de_joel_robuchon_2009">
    <img class="left third shadow" src="/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/04_sweetbreads_with_cep_mushrooms.jpg" /></a>

* Mushrooms were in season, and it showed. Cep (porcini), chanterelle, morel,
  and others kept appearing at various restaurants. Thankfully, we like
  mushrooms, so we didn't complain.

* Judging solely by the food,
  [L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon](http://www.restaurants-joel-robuchon.com/modele.php?resto=2&ville=Paris&rub=presentation&image=1&langue=eng)
  was the best meal of the trip. Seating is shared counters around an open
  kitchen, worlds away from white tablecloth French service, but
  we were there for the food, and it delivered. Highlights included
  [Ibérico ham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamón_ibérico) that literally
  melted in our mouths, a simple but perfectly combined
  [tuna nicoise salad](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/03_tuna_nicoise_salad.jpg),
  an incredible
  [sweetbread and mushroom](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/04_sweetbreads_with_cep_mushrooms.jpg)
  course, impossibly silky mashed potatoes, and a
  [Paris-Brest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Brest) that was so good, my
  eyes involuntarily closed every time I took a bite.

  If you like food and you're in Paris, try to get a seat here. They only take
  reservations for 6:30, so make one ahead of time, or come late on
  a weeknight. It's worth it.


### Sommières:

* So fresh, so clean, so sweet apricot confitade from
  [Marmelure &  Confitade](http://marmeluretconfitade.fr/?lang=en&page=presentation),
  spread on fresh
  [baguette tradition](http://www.moulins-bourgeois.com/baguette_tradition.html)
  from the neighborhood boulangerie where Jeremy's mom went to get bread
  when she was a child.

* [Mouton La Clotte](http://clotte.free.fr/une_passion_copie%281%29.htm) from
  [Château La Clotte-Fontane](http://www.charlesnealselections.com/wine/languedoc-rousillon/la-clotte-fontane/).
  One of the best wines I had on the trip. Of course, half the fun was
  [tasting it with the people who made it](/2009-10-29_south_of_france#clotte-fontane).

  <a href="/south_of_france_2009">
    <img class="right third shadow" src="/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/market_olives.jpg" /></a>

* [Fougasse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fougasse_%28bread%29), a heavy
  savory bread with olive oil, olives, and bits of duck and bacon. Commonly
  eaten at breakfast in parts of southern France.

* An amazing variety of
  [olives and tapenade](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/market_olives.jpg),
  [cheeses](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/market_cheese.jpg), and
  [meats](/w/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/market_meat_sausages.jpg)
  at the [Sommières Sunday market](/2009-10-29_south_of_france#market).
