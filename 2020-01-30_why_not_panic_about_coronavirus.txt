The [Wuhan coronavirus outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Wuhan_coronavirus_outbreak) has been big news lately. Lots of us are scared, like we were during SARS, H1N1, and others, and most news coverage just fans those flames.

Fortunately, I don't think we need to worry. Here's a condensed, lightly edited version of conversation I had with a smart, thoughtful friend recently about why.


_[Friend] I used to work with [famous researcher] at his virus discovery lab. I remember one time...I sat down next to them for dinner, everyone around me was laughing really hard at something. He turned to me and said "Hey, we were just talking about SARS." He went on to say after the post-mortem analysis was done, that if SARS had been as contagious as the flu, that they would not have been able to contain the epidemic. The result would have been that, world-wide, about half a billion (not million, billion with a "b") people would have died. We just got lucky._

_With Wuhan coronavirus, we are not going to get lucky._

1. _Wuhan coronavirus is contagious before people have symptoms. This property makes it basically impossible to contain by screening for it._

2. _["Almost certainly many tens of thousands of people are infected."](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-warn-of-possible-sustained-global-spread-of-new-coronavirus/) Unfortunately the CCP in fact suppressed knowledge of the virus from the public for many days, even after their scientists knew about it; [it is their fault that their massive quarantine was too late](http://chinamediaproject.org/2020/01/27/dramatic-actions/)._

3. _[It may not be as deadly as SARS, but it is deadly enough.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/26/2019-ncov-china-epidemic-pandemic-the-wuhan-coronavirus-a-tentative-clinical-profile/). It seems to be harder on older people than younger people. "We do not know how lethal the new coronavirus is. While the single figures of deaths in early January seemed reassuring, the death toll has now climbed to above 3 percent."_

_Fortunately it seems that [to get the virus you must get physically close to someone who has it](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/26/2019-ncov-china-epidemic-pandemic-the-wuhan-coronavirus-a-tentative-clinical-profile/). "The coronavirus is a physically large virusâ€”in relative terms, at just 125 nanometers with a surface of spike projections, too big to survive or stay suspended in the air for hours or travel more than a few feet. Like influenza, this coronavirus spreads through both direct and indirect contact. Direct contact occurs through the physical transfer of the microorganism among friends and family through close contact with oral secretions. Indirect contact results when an infected person coughs or sneezes, spreading coronavirus droplets on nearby surfaces, including knobs, bedrails, and smartphones."_

_Even so, I think very soon a time may come when we are likely to all want to just stay home for a while, and if we do go anywhere, not use public transit._


[Me] Interesting! I'm no expert in any of this. I'm a computer scientist and amateur computational biologist, not an epidemiologist. I do know pandemic risk is significant, generally speaking, and that we can definitely improve our containment and response coordination worldwide.

Having said that, fears around flu pandemics like coronavirus historically seem consistently overblown. **For context, ["normal" flu averages 3-5M cases and 300-600k deaths per year worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza).** In comparison, most recent pandemics that got everyone so worked up were many orders of magnitude smaller:

* [SARS: 8422 cases, 775-835 deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome#Epidemiology)
* [H5N1 aka bird flu: 630 cases, 375 deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1)
* [MERS aka camel flu: 2494 cases, 858 deaths](https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/) ([more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome))

(Incidentally, those numbers make me curious about [researcher]'s alternative SARS estimate of 500M deaths if it spread like the flu. [SARS's fatality rate averaged 11%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome#Epidemiology), so that would mean 4.5B cases, ie 2/3 of all people in the world, compared with 3-5M actual flu cases yearly. Do flu shots really make up the difference and prevent 99.9% of cases worldwide?!)

To address your specific arguments:

> Wuhan coronavirus is contagious before people have symptoms.

Coronavirus's estimated 1-14d incubation period does seem long at the high end, but it's basically the same range as [SARS's 1-14d (4-6d average)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome#Signs_and_symptoms), [MERS's 2-15d (5.5d average)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome#Signs_and_symptoms), and [H5N1's 2-17d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_and_infection_of_H5N1#Symptoms). (Sounds like it's too early to know coronavirus's average yet.)

> Unfortunately the CCP in fact suppressed knowledge of the virus from the public for many days, even after their scientists knew about it;

Yup. Extremely unfortunate.

> It may not be as deadly as SARS, but it is deadly enough...the death toll has now climbed to above 3 percent.

Agreed. Thank god that early 3% fatility rate estimate is way lower than SARS's 11%, MERS's ~40%, or H5N1's 50-60%.

Again, I'm no epidemiologist, but if I'm going to get scared about something, I'll probably opt for something like climate crisis or the threats to western democracy instead. You know, the "easy" stuff.


_Note that SARS, H5N1, and MERS were all *contained*.  In particular SARS was *detectable* as soon as it was *contagious*.  Wuhan is not, and, given how widespread it is already, it is therefore not going to be contained._

_Also, I'm not sure I follow your estimate:_

* _For SARS, a naive estimate is 11% of 6.36B people (in 2003) = 0.7B, about order of magnitude a half billion people._
* _For Wuhan, a naive estimate is is 3% of 7.8B people (today) = 0.23B, or about order of magnitude a quarter billion people._



Good point that those examples were contained. It's still too early to know whether coronavirus will be contained, but looking at H1N1 in 2009 as a comparable pandemic that also wasn't contained, [it resulted in 151-579k deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic), ie basically the same number as the normal flu each year.

As for the estimates, you're assuming that everyone in the world contracts the disease, which seems unrealistic. [11-21% of the world population contracted H1N1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic), for example. Only 3-5M people contract normal flu each year, despite the flu vaccine's ["low" overall uptake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine#Uptake) and [average 30-40% effectiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine#Effectiveness). And as you mentioned, coronavirus's spread is limited, similar to the flu.


_Ok, but how can this be? So this is a really interesting question and a complete hole in my model, or perhaps, an alternative dimension: how can a virus that ends up everywhere not infect everyone? There are very few isolated societies anymore and they are very small. The only way I can model this in my head is that perhaps everyone actually gets it but most people can fight it off and never even have symptoms? I cannot think of how else this can happen. Maybe that is the case here._


"Why" questions are hard, and I'm again way outside my wheelhouse here. I think the answer is that getting sick from any given pathogen is the exception, not the rule. We're all exposed to many of them every single day, and we shrug off almost all of them. Plus, we then have antibodies to protect us in the future.

Vaccines are a perfect example. We deliberately expose ourselves just enough to get antibodies, but not actually get sick. It's a pretty amazing trick.

Biology and ecosystems are vast and noisy and messy and approximate, unlike engineering. To our benefit, in this case!
