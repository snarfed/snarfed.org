A search engine for the whole [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) has been a [hot conversation topic](https://quickthoughts.jgregorymcverry.com/2018/11/25/scoping-out-basics-of-indieweb-search), on and off, for many years now. Many of us have [search](https://indieweb.org/search) on our own individual sites, and more ambitious projects like [cweiske](https://cweiske.de/)'s [phinde](https://cweiske.de/tagebuch/phinde.htm) can [search IRC archives](http://indiechat.search.cweiske.de/), but building a full fledged search engine to crawl and index _all_ IndieWeb sites has always been a bit too big a project to bite off. (Not to mention the question of [which sites we should include](https://indiemap.org/docs.html#sites) in the first place.)

As usual, my first instinct is always [software prevention](https://snarfed.org/2017-01-23_23351). Whatever the task at hand is, someone has else has pretty much always tried to do it before. Often they've even succeeded, to some degree. Search is certainly no exception.
