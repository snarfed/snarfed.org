One of my favorite podcasts in recent memory, BBC's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04b1g3c">50 Things That Made the Modern Economy</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fifty-Things-that-Modern-Economy/dp/0349142637/">is now a book</a>. Thoughtful, original, and fun. Congratulations <a href="http://timharford.com">Tim Harford</a>!

When they <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csvt0l">asked for suggestions for a 51st thing</a>, I proposed the threaded screw. ?

Before it, fasteners were non-standard at best. Nails didn't last. Others were hard to make or use. How many screws and bolts are made now? A million per person? Truly a key part of the modern economy.
