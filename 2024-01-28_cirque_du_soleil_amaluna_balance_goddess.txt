Saw Cirque du Soleil's _Kooza_ last night. It was great. But the one act of theirs I'll never forget was from over a decade ago: [Lara Jacobs's](https://www.thalo.com/articles/view/429/the_nature_of_balance_lara_jacobs_balance_goddess) [_Balance Goddess_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2Ig4VtMKg) in [_Amaluna_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaluna). Didn't feel like a circus act at all; it was quiet, meditative, haunting. Started simply, balancing a few palm ribs on each other, but by the end of it, she'd constructed an elaborate maze of them, from tiny to massive, perfectly and impossibly hanging in midair, defying all known physics. Otherworldly. One of the most incredible things I've ever seen. [](/2013-11-13_cirque-du-soleil-amaluna)
