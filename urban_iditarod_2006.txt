Urban Iditarod 2006

I ran in the [Urban Iditarod](http://www.urbaniditarod.com/) on Saturday! Here
in San Francisco, we don't have the facilities to run a [real Alaskan
Iditarod](http://www.iditarod.com/). Still, we're not about to give up, so we
make a few compromises and run our very own race.

[My original post](/2006-03-05_urban_iditarod) has a longer description, and

Mush, you huskies, mush!
