I don't spend much time on software engineering media, if any, but one of the few pieces of analysis I regularly read and love is the Thoughtworks Radar. Broad, clear-eyed, hands on, eminently useful. Bite-sized analyses of ~100 tools and techniques (both new and old), adopt/trial/assess/hold recommendations, and a nod toward overarching themes. ~40 pages, twice a year.

The latest volume came out recently, and as usual, it's a banger. I'm only maybe a quarter of the way through, and I already have todos to learn more about run cost prediction, 

Not an ad, I have no affiliation. Just good stuff.
