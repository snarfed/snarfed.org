Hi everyone! Time for a [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) status update. We have a lot of new features and bug fixes to announce [since the last time](/2025-02-04_54609), so here we go!

* [Added a web-based UI for enabling and configuring the bridge for your accounts.](https://blog.anew.social/bridgy-fed-config-patreon/)
* [Added support for fediverse split domain mode](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1031), ie when your webfinger address and server are on different domains
* We now [fully support Bluesky custom handle changes and propagate them to bridged accounts](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1074)
* [Fediverse instance admins can now automatically enable the bridge for their users and automatically give them custom Bluesky handles](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1305)
* [Redesigned our Bluesky firehose server](https://github.com/snarfed/arroba/issues/30), which has significantly improved its reliability and reduced delays [in both directions](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1641)
* [Implemented](https://github.com/snarfed/arroba/issues/52) [ATProto sync v1.1](https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0006-sync-iteration). This isn't a user-visible change, but it's an important part of reducing the cost of running an ATProto relay
* [Implemented pinned posts for fediverse => Bluesky](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1374)
* [Detect videos that are too long for Bluesky and link to them instead of including them as broken video embeds](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1353) (thank you [@Daft-Freak](https://github.com/Daft-Freak)!)
* [Improved our compatibility with Mastodon profile updates](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1877#issuecomment-2800033419)
* [Improved our](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1839) [handling of HTML](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1615) in web link previews
* [Made DMs smarter about understanding handle formats and encodings](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1936#issuecomment-2899183997)
* [Started using an image proxy for Threads](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1825), to work around its image URLs expiring
* [Bug fix for images that are reused across fediverse posts and drafts](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1650)
* [Link to audio attachments instead of ignoring them](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy-fed/issues/1503) (thank you [@Daft-Freak](https://github.com/Daft-Freak)!)
