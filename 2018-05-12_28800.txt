Learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing,_Oklahoma#Oil_industry">Cushing, Oklahoma oil interchange</a> today, one of the largest in the world. <a href="https://www.honiron.com/manifold-applications-oil-gas-industry/">Its oil manifolds have automated electrical valves</a> that transfer millions of barrels of oil automatically, just like packets routed through switching fabrics and router backplanes in the internet's Tier 1 peering points. So cool!
