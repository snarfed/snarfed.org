<p>Thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Sassaman">Len Sassaman</a>, remembering him fondly. Good times on the <a href="https://p2p-hackers.zooko.narkive.com/">p2p-hackers mailing list</a>, at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeCon">CodeCon</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperHappyDevHouse">SuperHappyDevHouse</a>, and elsewhere. Giant of the cypherpunk and security communities, unfailingly kind and generous to me and others, truly good person. We lost you before your time.</p>
