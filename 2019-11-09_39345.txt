A few days ago, I unfollowed everyone on Twitter, added them all to a [list](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76460-how-to-use-twitter-lists), and I now read that list instead. It's shockingly better. Only their own tweets and retweets, in order. No ads, no "liked by," no "people you may know," no engagement hacking crap. It's glorious.

Even better, when I inevitably end up in the home timeline anyway, it only has my own tweets and ads, nothing interesting. No dopamine outrage bullshit cycle to get caught up in.

Shh, don't tell, I'm afraid some low level product manager at Twitter will discover this and "fix" lists like they "fixed" the home timeline a while back.

There are a couple drawbacks. I lost a few people I followed whose accounts are protected; I need to find and re-follow them. Also this evidently makes it harder for people to DM me, somehow. Not sure how, I don't use Twitter DM much.

Still. Glorious.
