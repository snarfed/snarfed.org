One of the main [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com/) goals is to do more social
networking on our own personal web sites, instead of on
[silos](http://indiewebcamp.com/silos) like Facebook and Twitter. To do this,
our web servers need to talk to each other. That's what the
[webmention protocol](http://webmention.org/) is for, and it works great, but
it's still young, so many big web hosts don't support it yet.

To address this, I've launched a new [Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy/) feature that
adds webmention support to [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/),
[Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/), and [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/).
When you sign up, Bridgy starts receiving incoming webmentions for your blog
posts and adds them as comments. It also notices when you publish a new post and
sends webmentions to other sites that you link to.

This lets bloggers send IndieWeb
[comments](http://indiewebcamp.com/comment),
[likes](http://indiewebcamp.com/like),
[event RSVPs](http://indiewebcamp.com/rsvp), and even
[private messages](http://indiewebcamp.com/indieweb-messaging). It also lets
them [use Bridgy](https://www.brid.gy/about#which) to show comments and likes
from social networks on their blog posts (aka
[backfeed](http://indiewebcamp.com/backfeed)).

If you're on Blogger, Tumblr, or WordPress.com,
[give it a shot](https://www.brid.gy/) and let me know what you think!
