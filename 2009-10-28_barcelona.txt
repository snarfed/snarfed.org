I'm glad we made time on our [vacation](/2009-10-27_back_from_vacation)
to hop over to Barcelona, instead of staying solely in
[Paris](/2009-10-28_paris) and
the [south of France](/2009-10-29_south_of_france). The
transatlantic trek and logistics were enough effort that it was worth
travelling and seeing more of Europe while we were there.

More importantly, Barcelona was a blast, and a distinct contrast from
[Paris](/2009-10-28_paris). Paris was historic, intellectual, cultured,
and impossibly chic, but Barcelona was bright, loud, and full of life, in all
the best ways. I'm glad I saw it.

Here are some highlights and thoughts, in roughly chronological order.
Also see the [pictures](/barcelona_2009).

* [La Rambla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla,_Barcelona), one of the
  most famous and attractive streets in the world. It's lined with trees,
  historic shops and open air markets, incredible street performers, and lots
  of both tourists and natives.

  One memorable highlight was the cluster of street vendors selling live pet
  birds. Their stacks of bird cages easily stood out from the throngs. Fun
  fact: when the vendors go home, they just throw a tarp over their cages and
  leave the birds there for the night.

* [Montjuïc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montjuïc), the large park and open
  space that contains Poble Espanyol, the Olympic stadium, and other notable
  locations. It reminded me of the Presidio in San Francisco, especially
  seeing how much it's treasured by Barcelona locals.

* On a related note, the
  [Olympic Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estadi_Olímpic_Lluís_Companys),
  village, and facilities were suitably impressive, and definitely worth
  visiting. It's sad that the stadium and other facilities are barely used
  any more!

* The official language is
  [Catalan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language), which is
  somewhat between Spanish and French, similar to Portuguese. Many natives
  actually speak it as their first language. Most official signs were in
  both Spanish and Catalan, with the occasional addition of English.
  Evidently the Eastern region of
  [Valencia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia,_Spain) has its own
  similar sublanguage, [Valencian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencian).

* [Poble Espanyol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poble_Espanyol), a synthetic
  little village that has traditional Spanish architecture, crafts, and
  other artifacts from various periods.

* [Plaça Espanya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaça_Espanya) is one of the
  central squares in the city. It's a transportation, sightseeing, and
  shopping hub, so we ended up there often before and after different day trips.

* [Modernista architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernisme#Modernisme_in_architecture_and_the_plastic_arts)
  everywhere. So fun, and definitely my style. Evidently much of Barcelona was
  built up in the recent 20th century, culminating in their hosting the
  Olympics in 1992, so they had more space and interest in unusual,
  progressive architecture and public sculpture.

  Notable pieces included [Gaudí](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaudí)'s
  [La Sagrada Familia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Sagrada_Familia)
  (of course), [La Pedrera](http://www.lapedreraeducacio.org/eng/index.htm),
  [Torre Agbar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_Agbar) (somewhat), and many
  other buildings and public sculptures. I particularly enjoyed how much of it
  was still actively used today.

  I was also struck by the natural connection with other similar Spanish (and
  European) movements and aesthetics, like
  [magical realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_realism) and
  [cubism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubism),
  similar to how other movements like
  [impressionism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism)
  spanned visual art, music, and literature.

* The beaches at Miramar and
  [Barceloneta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barceloneta,_Barcelona)
  exemplified the energetic, vibrant atmosphere in Barcelona. It may have
  been mid week in October, but it still gave Ibiza a run for its money. You
  can't go wrong with sun, waves, live music, and a crowd of people having
  fun.

* The [Barri Gòtic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Gòtic) was a very fun,
  very European walking district with lots of open air shops, restaurants,
  live music, and other activities. We caught a surprisingly good jazz group
  playing at [Jamboree](http://www.masimas.com/jamboree/) on our last night,
  which we enjoyed a lot.

* I was delighted, if not surprised, that [chocolate](/chocolate)
  played a more important role in the culture. Locals ate and drank it more
  often as a snack, and tended to understand and appreciated quality
  chocolate. More details in the
  [food and drink highlights post](/2009-10-30_food_highlights).

* [Montserrat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_%28mountain%29) is a steep
  mountain, national park, and historic Benedictine abbey near Barcelona. It
  was a great day trip. The cable car and funiculars we took up from the
  foot of the mountain were stunning, as were the
  [views from the top](/barcelona_2009).

  The monastery's chapel was also one of the most striking and memorable we
  saw, even considering the competition in [Paris](/2009-10-28_paris),
  the Sagrada Familia, and others on the trip.
