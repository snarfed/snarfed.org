OpenID comments

<p class="right"><a href="http://openid.net/"><img class="" src="/openid-logo.png" /></a></p>

A while back, I posted an
[OpenID server plugin](/2006-10-20_openid_server_for_pyblosxom) for
[PyBlosxom](https://pyblosxom.github.io/), the software that <strike>runs</strike>
used to run this site.

Since then, I've added support for
[OpenID comments](#comment-anchor), using
the [comments_openid.py plugin](/pyblosxom_openid_comments).
I've updated it to work with recent versions of PyBlosxom and
[JanRain](http://www.janrain.com/)'s
[Python OpenID library](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/libraries/python/),
and to use the nickname provided by the
[Simple Registration Extension](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/simple-registration-extension).

Feel free to [try it out](#comment-anchor)! If
you don't have an OpenID yet, you can get one at
[MyOpenID](http://www.myopenid.com/).
