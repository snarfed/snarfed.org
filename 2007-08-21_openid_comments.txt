OpenID comments

<p class="right"><a href="http://openid.net/"><img class="" src="/openid-logo.png" /></a></p>

A while back, I posted an [OpenID server plugin](/2006-10-20_openid_server_for_pyblosxom) for [PyBlosxom](http://pyblosxom.bluesock.org/), the software that <strike>runs</strike>
used to run this site.

Since then, I've added support for [OpenID comments](#comment-anchor), using the [comments_openid.py plugin](/pyblosxom_openid_comments). I've updated it to work with recent versions of PyBlosxom and [JanRain](http://www.janrain.com/)'s [Python OpenID library](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/libraries/python/), and to use the nickname provided by the [Simple Registration Extension](http://www.openidenabled.com/openid/simple-registration-extension).

Feel free to [try it out](#comment-anchor)! If you don't have an OpenID yet, you can get one at [MyOpenID](http://www.myopenid.com/).
