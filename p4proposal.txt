### Toward an Application-Independent Distributed Network Platform


We propose a distributed, peer-to-peer network platform with an extensible
plugin architecture. This will allow developers to build their own
network-aware applications without having to recreate middle-level network
services. We plan to deliver a network client as well as at least one, and
possibly two plugins: a networked DJ and an anonymous web browsing proxy.

The unique advantages of a distributed network architecture are flexibility,
fault-tolerance, and lawyer resistance. The platform will support both
broadcast and direct send/receive operations. Users will be separate from
hosts, so that a user can log onto the network from any computer. Both
authentication and data encryption will be built in from the ground up.

### Introduction

Distributed networks, especially peer-to-peer networks, are currently in vogue.
Akamai has built a billion dollar company around a distributed content delivery
platform. The peer-to-peer Gnutella network is the early successor to Napster's
throne, due in no small part to the interoperability of different clients that
implement its protocol. The upcoming Emerging Technology conference, hailed as
&quot;one of the industry's best trend-setters and predictors, bar
none...&quot; picked peer-to-peer networking as its theme this year.

Many people see the motivations for peer-to-peer networks as questionable.
While this can't be quantified, it is evident that two of the primary
attractions of peer-to-peer networks are easy (and often illegal) file sharing
and resistance to lawsuits. However, as a network paradigm, peer-to-peer is a
viable alternative to more traditional options like server-client,
hierarchical, and ring networks. Furthermore, peer-to-peer is not new. As far
back as ARPANET, low-level routing in the Internet has been performed with
distributed algorithms and a peer-to-peer architecture.

The original goal for the Internet's core protocols (IP, UDP, and TCP) was to
provide fault-tolerant per-hop and end-to-end network functionality. They have
accomplished this goal admirably. However, they provide only low-level
services. There is an insufficient number of standard, widespread protocols for
middle-level network services. These include user location and authentication,
secure communication, and common application discovery. To support popular
services like instant messaging and file sharing, applications have been forced
to create their own middle-level protocols. Possibly hundreds or even thousands
of programmer-years have been spent duplicating these kinds of services. We
hope to remedy this.

### Proposal

We propose to create a generic distributed network platform. The most salient
feature of the platform is its plugin architecture. We will provide application
developers with a small number of basic network operations such as direct send
and receive, broadcast, user location and authentication, data encryption, and
common application discovery. Using these middle-level services, we hope that
developers will be able to create network-aware applications more quickly. More
importantly, we hope that this will encourage developers to move toward
standard middle-level services and platforms (like ours) instead of recreating
these services over and over.

We also propose to deliver at least one substantial plugin on this platform. We
plan to create a &quot;networked DJ&quot; plugin that can coordinate multiple
computers to play music at a party. When a client joins a party using this
plugin, it will synchronize the client's MP3 player to the currently playing
song. It will also download the playlist and any songs that the client doesn't
have. Users with DJ permissions will be able to change the playlist and the
currently playing song. We hope this will be popular in smaller hall parties
and progressives, where the default source of music is a boombox on full volume
at one end of the hall.

There are many other compelling ideas for plugins. We could port an existing
instant messaging client to our platform or implement a new one. We could write
a file sharing client in the vein of Napster, Morpheus, and Gnutella. We could
create a distributed computing plugin that would download and complete
&quot;work units&quot; from services like Seti@Home and Distributed.net.
Lastly, we could design a web anonymizer that uses the platform as a proxy
server. HTTP requests and replies could be routed through any node on the
network, so that standard web transactions could take place but no personally
identifying information (such as IP address) would be revealed. If we have
time, we may implement one of these plugins.

### Related Work

Sun's recently announced JXTA project is somewhat similar to our platform. JXTA
is a set of open protocols for peer-to-peer network communication, along with
reference implementations in Java. Sun's goals for JXTA are close to our own
goals, but JXTA is more a toolkit of loosely connected parts than a unified
platform. Also, JXTA is in the working stages right now, so production-level
code is still some time away.

Many current peer-to-peer applications provided inspiration for the protocol
design of our network. Gnutella is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol
implemented by a wide variety of clients. Gnutella is tailored specifically for
file sharing - it provides no user authentication, and it uses a network
horizon so each client only sees a fraction of the network at a time. Freenet
and Free Haven are more sophisticated. They provide distributed, anonymous,
high-performance data havens. They are provably anonymous for file requesters,
and it can be shown that hosts cannot determine the contents of files that are
replicated to their cache. Mojo Nation takes this a step further by introducing
the concept of accountability - access control for a host is determined by the
amount of resources that it provides.

Perhaps the closest available program to our project is the Brilliant platform.
Brilliant is a trojan program built into KaZaa, a popular file sharing program.
Brilliant allows its parent company, Brilliant Digital Entertainment, to use
unused clock cycles and hard drive space on clients where it is installed.
However, this was not disclosed to KaZaa users, and it was only recently
discovered in an FTC filing. Needless to say, we do not plan to distribute our
platform in this manner. Furthermore, there are no white papers or technical
briefs on Brilliant's network architecture, so we cannot learn much from it.

### Usage Scenarios

We identify two primary usage scenarios: developers and end users. We plan to
invest time into both the plugin API and the user interface of our network
client. Since we are building a platform and not just a consumer program, we
must consider the API we export to developers. Primarily, it should be complete
and minimal. In other words, it should expose all of the platform's
functionality, but the number of discrete operations and entry points should be
kept to a minimum. Compiling and testing plugins for the platform should be
similar to using any other third-party libraries, such as windowing toolkit or
text parsers. The API should also provide mechanisms to access debugging
information.

The network client is a launching pad for plugins that use the platform. It
will show all of the plugins that are currently installed, and will allow the
user to load new plugins. It may show other relevant information, such as
network statistics or a &quot;buddy list&quot; of users who are logged on. In
the interest of simplicity, these will be the only features of the network
client. All other user interaction will be handled by the plugins.

The &quot;networked DJ&quot; plugin will use Winamp to decode and play MP3
files. As such, it will also be a Winamp plugin. Winamp will be the main user
interface, so pressing the play button will sync transparently. There may be a
dialog box for configuration, but it should be minimal. The anonymous web proxy
will be implemented as a proxy server with no user interface at all. It will be
turned on or off in the network client. The instructions for configuring IE or
Netscape to use a proxy server can be included with the plugin.

### Known Issues

The main issue we foresee is that this project may be too ambitious in scope.
All of us have significant experience with large programming projects, so size
is probably not an issue. However, this project touches many different
technical fields, such as networking, encryption and authentication, audio
syncing, and statistical methods. No one group member is competent in all of
these fields, and there are some fields with which only one or two members have
significant experience.

Two areas that could cause problems are multithreading and the plugin
architecture. To support arbitrarily complex plugins, we may need to allow
plugins to run in their own thread(s). This is a concern because multithreaded
network applications tend to be unwieldy. Also, I personally do not have
experience developing pluggable programs, which could be a technical challenge.

Lastly, the platform must be built before any plugins can be tested on it. This
may take a substantial amount of time, and it will be difficult to develop
plugins until the platform is stable. It may be awkward to schedule development
around this.
